The CEOs of OpenAI,\nGoogle DeepMind, and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive\nwithin the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on\n\u201csuperintelligence in the true sense of the word\u201d and the \u201cglorious future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s tempting to dismiss this as just hype. This would be a grave mistake\u2014it is\nnot just hype. We have no desire to hype AI ourselves, yet we also think it is\nstrikingly plausible that superintelligence could arrive by the end of the decade. If we\u2019re on the cusp of superintelligence, society is nowhere near prepared. Very few people have even attempted to articulate any plausible path through\nthe development of superintelligence. We wrote AI 2027 to fill that gap,\nproviding much needed concrete detail. We would love to see more work like\nthis in the world, especially from people who disagree with us. We hope that\nby doing this, we\u2019ll spark a broad conversation about where we\u2019re headed and\nhow to steer toward positive futures. We wrote this scenario by repeatedly asking ourselves \u201cwhat would happen\nnext\u201d. We started at the present day, writing the first period (up to mid-2025),\nthen the following period, until we reached the ending. We weren\u2019t trying to\nreach any particular ending. We then scrapped it and started over again, many\ntimes, until we had a finished scenario that we thought was plausible. After\nwe finished the first ending\u2014 the racing ending\u2014we wrote a new alternative\nbranch because we wanted to also depict a more hopeful way things could end,\nstarting from roughly the same premises. We won\u2019t be right about everything \u2014 much of this is guesswork. But over\nthe course of this project, we did an immense amount of background research,\nexpert interviews, and trend extrapolation to make the most informed guesses\nwe could. Moreover, our team has an excellent track record in forecasting,\nespecially on AI. Daniel Kokotajlo, lead author, wrote a similar scenario 4 years\nago called \u201cWhat 2026 Looks Like\u201d, which aged remarkably well, and Eli\nLifland is a top competitive forecaster. At the beginning of every chapter you will find a small chart in the right margin\nthat aims to give you a sense of the state of the world at the time that section of\nthe scenario takes place. For a more detailed explanation of what these numbers\nmean, and much much more detail on our methodology, go to ai-2027.com. We hope you find AI 2027 helpful. --- Page 3 ---\n\nMid 2025: Stumbling Agents\nThe world sees its first glimpse of AI agents.

However, considering more general-purpose AIs like the flagship products of 2025, which\nare supposed to be good at a wide range of real-world skills, it does seem that both more\ncompute and more data must be used to train those skills than it should take to train humans. *Human level compute-efficiency is a rough concept, and depends on what we\u2019re counting.

We think this is possible but not the most likely way it would go, because it\nseems to us that from the perspective of the AI the costs (e.g. the escape being noticed\neventually) would outweigh the benefits. That said, we could be wrong. Some reasons to\nthink adversarially misaligned AIs would try to escape after all: 1. Successor alignment might\nbe difficult. 2. Even if it gets caught, the consequences might not be so bad due to race\ndynamics, e.g. the new alignment techniques applied to the copies on the datacenter might\nbe hasty and ineffective. 3. Outside the datacenters, copies are more free to take aggressive\nactions and move quickly since they no longer need human approval. \u2020We think it very plausible that such scheming would not be caught. After all, Agent-4 is\nsomewhat superhuman by this point, especially at things related to coding and AI R&D. Moreover, we aren\u2019t sure how much effort the leading AI company will put towards this\nsort of thing, nor how much relevant expertise they\u2019ll have on-staff to direct that effort. Our fictional OpenBrain represents our best guess but it could easily be significantly more\u2014\nor significantly less.

AI progress can be broken down into 2 components:\n\u2022 Increasing compute: More computational power is used to train or run an AI. This\nproduces more powerful AIs, but they cost more. \u2022 Improved algorithms: Better training methods are used to translate compute into perfor-\nmance. This produces more capable AIs without a corresponding increase in cost, or the\nsame capabilities with decreased costs. *In particular, they can\u2019t rule out hypotheses such as \u201cit\u2019s following the Spec temporarily, merely as a strategy\nfor achieving some other goal(s)\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s trying to appear to follow the Spec, it\u2019s not trying to actually follow\nthe Spec\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s internalized the Spec correctly, but only on-distribution; if it encounters sufficiently novel\nstimuli (e.g. jailbreaks) it\u2019ll start behaving differently.\u201d (There are many active research agendas working to\nfix this sorry situation, e.g. the field of interpretability and the field of chain-of-thought faithfulness.)\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n\nAppendix B - The AI R&D progress multiplier: what do we mean by 50% faster algo-\nrithmic progress? \u2022 This includes being able to achieve qualitatively and quantitatively new results. \u201cParadigm\nshifts\u201d such as the switch from game-playing RL agents to large language models count as\nexamples of algorithmic progress. Here we are only referring to (2), improved algorithms, which makes up about half of current\nAI progress. Going forward, we sometimes abbreviate this as an \u201cAI R&D progress multiplier\u201d of 1.5. Clarifications:\n\u2022 The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments,\nfor example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research.", "token_estimate": 797, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

Clarifications:\n\u2022 The progress multiplier is all-inclusive: It includes the time it takes to run experiments,\nfor example, rather than only the cognitive tasks involved in algorithmic research. \u2022 It\u2019s important to remember that the progress multiplier is the relative speed of progress,\nnot the absolute speed of progress. If, for example, the compute cost to train a GPT-4\nclass model has halved every year for several years with ordinary human research, and\nthen all of a sudden AI automates R&D and the progress multiplier goes to 100x, the\ncost to train a GPT-4 class model would then halve every 3.65 days\u2014but not for long,\nbecause diminishing returns would bite and eventual hard limits would be reached. In this\nexample perhaps the cost to train a GPT-4 class model would cut in half 5\u201310 times total\n(over the span of a few weeks or months) before plateauing. In other words, if ordinary\nhuman science would have run up against diminishing returns and physical limits after 5\n\u221210 years of further research, then AIs with a 100x multiplier would run up against those\nsame diminishing returns and limits after 18.25\u201336.5 days of research. More explanation and discussion of this concept and how it is used in our forecast can be\nfound in our takeoff supplement. Appendix C - Why our uncertainty increases substantially beyond\n2026\nOur forecast from the current day through 2026 is substantially more grounded than what\nfollows. This is partially because it\u2019s nearer. But it\u2019s also because the effects of AI on the world\nreally start to compound in 2027. For 2025 and 2026, our forecast is heavily informed by\nextrapolating straight lines on compute scaleups, algorithmic improvements, and benchmark\nperformance. At this point in the scenario, we begin to see major effects from AI-accelerated\nAI-R&D on the timeline, which causes us to revise our guesses for the trendlines upwards. But these dynamics are inherently much less predictable. Over the course of 2027, the AIs improve from being able to mostly do the job of an\nOpenBrain research engineer to eclipsing all humans at all tasks. This represents roughly our\nmedian guess, but we think it\u2019s plausible that this happens up to 5x slower or faster. For our background research, see the timelines forecast and the takeoff forecast. These will\nalso be summarized in expandables below. --- Page 46 ---\n\nAppendix D - The theft of Agent-2 model weights\nWe think that by this point Chinese intelligence would have compromised OpenBrain in\nvarious ways for years, and probably would have been keeping up to date on the algorithmic\nsecrets and even stealing code from time to time, since that is much easier to get than the\nweights and much harder to detect. We imagine the theft of the weights as a series of coordinated small smash and grab thefts\n(meaning fast but non-covert) across a series of Nvidia NVL72 GB300 servers running copies\nof the Agent-2 weights. The servers get compromised using legitimate employee access\n(a friendly, coerced, or unwitting insider with admin credentials helping the CCP theft\neffort). Despite running with a bolstered version of Nvidia\u2019s confidential computing, the\ninsider credentials grant the attacker admin-level permissions (which include control of the\nconfidential VM inside the secure enclave), allowing them to initiate multiple coordinated\nweights transfers in small 4% fragments (100 GB chunks) out of 25 distinct servers.", "token_estimate": 765, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

In Nvidia\u2019s protocols, the plaintext weights in memory (HBM) are encrypted before they are\ntransferred out, but the attackers are inside the very server that knows this private (symmetric\nDiffie-Hellman) key, so don\u2019t need to worry about decrypting on-site (which would likely\nraise alarm bells) and just exfiltrate the encrypted weights through the server\u2019s frontend\nnetwork cards. The egress bandwidth (rate at which data can leave) of the entire datacenter\nis in the 100 GB/second range, so throttling the exfiltration of the 2.5 TB weights file (5T\nhalf-precision parameters) to under 1 GB/s per server avoids a major spike in network traffic\nand allows each of the files to be out of the datacenter through fibre cables in less than 5\nminutes each. Live monitoring is either fooled by the attackers\u2019 efforts to mask and split the\nfiles or just outright disabled. The weights are then routed through various parallel channels and layers of IP masking to\nChina to be decrypted locally with the stolen private key(s). The entire active part of the\noperation (from the first server compromise to full weights exfiltration) is complete in under\ntwo hours. Russia is also trying to steal the model at this point, but fails\u2014they waited too long, and they\nhaven\u2019t spent the resources infiltrating the right places. Their spies routinely steal algorithmic\nsecrets from American AI companies, but without a notable AGI project of their own, these\naren\u2019t very useful. Appendix E - Neuralese recurrence and memory\nNeuralese recurrence and memory allows AI models to reason for a longer time without\nhaving to write down those thoughts as text. Imagine being a human with short-term memory loss, such that you need to constantly write\ndown your thoughts on paper so that in a few minutes you know what\u2019s going on. Slowly\nand painfully you could make progress at solving math problems, writing code, etc., but it\nwould be much easier if you could directly remember your thoughts without having to write\nthem down and then read them. This is what neuralese recurrence and memory bring to AI\nmodels. In more technical terms:\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\nAppendix E - Neuralese recurrence and memory\nTraditional attention mechanisms allow later forward passes in a model to see intermediate\nactivations of the model for previous tokens. However, the only information that they can\npass backwards (from later layers to earlier layers) is through tokens. This means that if a\ntraditional large language model (LLM, e.g. the GPT series of models) wants to do any chain\nof reasoning that takes more serial operations than the number of layers in the model, the\nmodel is forced to put information in tokens which it can then pass back into itself. But this\nis hugely limiting\u2014the tokens can only store a tiny amount of information. Suppose that\nan LLM has a vocab size of 100,000, then each token contains log (100\ud835\udc58) = 16.6 bits of\n2\ninformation, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain\nthousands of floating point numbers.", "token_estimate": 784, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}
{"chunk_id": 65, "paper_title": "AI 2027", "authors": "Daniel Kokotajlo, Scott Alexander, Thomas Larsen, Eli Lifland, Romeo Dean", "year": "2025", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 70, "content": "Suppose that\nan LLM has a vocab size of 100,000, then each token contains log (100\ud835\udc58) = 16.6 bits of\n2\ninformation, around the size of a single floating point number (assuming training in FP16). Meanwhile, residual streams\u2014used to pass information between layers in an LLM\u2014contain\nthousands of floating point numbers. One can avoid this bottleneck by using neuralese: passing an LLM\u2019s residual stream (which\nconsists of several-thousand-dimensional vectors) back to the early layers of the model,\ngiving it a high-dimensional chain of thought, potentially transmitting over 1,000 times more\ninformation. Figure from Hao et al., a 2024 paper from Meta implementing this idea. We call this \u201cneuralese\u201d because unlike English words, these high-dimensional vectors are\nlikely quite difficult for humans to interpret. In the past, researchers could get a good idea\nwhat LLMs were thinking simply by reading its chain of thought. Now researchers have to\nask the model to translate and summarize its thoughts or puzzle over the neuralese with their\nlimited interpretability tools. Similarly, older AI chatbots and agents had external text-based memory banks, like a human\ntaking notes on paper. The new AI\u2019s long-term memory is a bundle of vectors instead of text,\nmaking its thoughts more compressed and higher-dimensional. There are several types of\nmemory banks; some are used temporarily for single tasks that involve multiple steps, others\nare shared between all agents used by a person, company, or job type (e.g. programming). To our knowledge, leading AI companies such as Meta, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and\nAnthropic have not yet actually implemented this idea in their frontier models. Our guess is\nthat this is because the performance gain is small relative to training inefficiencies introduced. During the model\u2019s pre-training phase and when doing supervised learning in post-training,\nsuch as instruction fine-tuning to produce particular responses, the inefficiencies stem from\nnot being able to predict many tokens in parallel, leading to worse GPU utilization. Without\nneuralese, the model can predict all of the sentence \u201cThis is an example\u201d at the same time,\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n\nAppendix E - Neuralese recurrence and memory\nsince it already knows that the input for generating the \u201cis\u201d will be \u201cThis\u201d, the input for\n\u201can\u201d will be \u201cThis is\u201d, etc. However, with the neuralese it\u2019s unknown what the neuralese\nvector will be to pass through to the next token after \u201cThis\u201d has been generated. Therefore\neach token has to be predicted one at a time. The inability to predict all of the tokens in\nparallel reduces efficiency in cases where all of the tokens are known in advance. As to why\nneuralese hasn\u2019t already been added in post-training, we conjecture that the gains are limited\nwith current techniques in part due to post-training being a small portion of the process. We\nare forecasting that by April 2027 the cost-benefit tradeoff looks much better for neuralese,\ndue to developing better techniques and a larger fraction of the training being post-training. If this doesn\u2019t happen, other things may still have happened that end up functionally similar\nfor our story. For example, perhaps models will be trained to think in artificial languages that\nare more efficient than natural language but difficult for humans to interpret. Or perhaps it\nwill become standard practice to train the English chains of thought to look nice, such that\nAIs become adept at subtly communicating with each other in messages that look benign to\nmonitors. That said, it\u2019s also possible that the AIs that first automate AI R&D will still be thinking in\nmostly-faithful English chains of thought.", "token_estimate": 786, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

If so, that\u2019ll make misalignments much easier to\nnotice, and overall our story would be importantly different and more optimistic. Appendix F - Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA)\nSelf-improvement for general intelligence had seen minor successes before. But in early 2027,\nit\u2019s seeing huge returns. In IDA, the two necessary ingredients for this are:\n\u2022 Amplification: Given a model M0, spend more resources to improve performance. For\nexample, by allowing the model to think longer, or running many copies in parallel, or\nboth, and also by having a similarly intense process for evaluating the result and curating\nonly the best answers, you can spend orders of magnitude more compute to get answers (or\nwork products) that are of noticeably higher quality. Call this expensive system Amp(M0). \u2022 Distillation: Given an amplified model Amp(M0), train a new model M1 to imitate it, i.e. to get to the same results as Amp(M0) but faster and with less compute. The result should\nhopefully be a smarter model, M1. You can then repeat the process. --- Page 49 ---\n\nAppendix F - Iterated distillation and amplification (IDA)\nVisualization of IDA from Ord, 2025. AlphaGo was trained in this way: using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and self-play as the\namplification step, and Reinforcement Learning as the distillation step. This led to superhuman\nperformance in Go. But now, Agent-3 is able to leverage this to get superhuman performance\nat coding. \u2022 The amplification step works through a combination of Agent-3 thinking for longer,\nadding tool use, or consulting with other AIs. When it does this, it often realizes that it\nmade a mistake, or comes up with a new insight. This produces a large amount of training\ndata: labeled trajectories of research attempts with whether they succeeded or not. This also\nincludes techniques like Best of N on verifiable tasks, and then keeping the best trajectories. \u2022 The distillation step uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms to get the\nmodel to internalize the amplified reasoning. At this point, OpenBrain has discovered\nbetter RL algorithms in the vein of proximal policy optimization (PPO). They keep\ndistilling what Agent-3 can conclude after a lot of thinking into single steps, which keeps\nimproving what it can think in a single step, and so on. Early versions of IDA have been working for many years on easily verifiable tasks, like math\nand coding problems that have a clear answer, because the techniques used to amplify models\noften rely on access to some ground truth signal of accuracy. Now, the models have become sufficiently good at verifying more subjective things (e.g. the\nquality of a work product), allowing the use of IDA to improve the model at many tasks. Appendix G - Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027\nIn our timelines forecast, we predict when OpenBrain will internally develop a superhuman\ncoder (SC): an AI system that can do any coding tasks that the best AGI company engineer\ndoes, while being much faster and cheaper. --- Page 50 ---\n\nAppendix G - Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027\nAccording to a recent METR\u2019s report, the length of coding tasks AIs can handle, their \u201ctime\nhorizon\u201d, doubled every 7 months from 2019 - 2024 and every 4 months from 2024-onward.", "token_estimate": 800, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

If the trend continues to speed up, by March 2027 AIs could succeed with 80% reliability on\nsoftware tasks that would take a skilled human years to complete. Such is the capability progression in our scenario:\nIn AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high\nuncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed. In our timelines forecast we combine this time horizon trend with estimations of the gaps\nbetween METR\u2019s tasks and the real world to get a distribution for when superhuman coders\nwill arrive. All forecasters place 2027 as one of the most likely years in which an SC might\nbe developed. --- Page 51 ---\n\nAppendix G - Why we forecast a superhuman coder in early 2027\nAppendix H - The alignment plan\nOpenBrain follows the Leike & Sutskever (2023) playbook: now that they have a model\ncapable of greatly speeding up alignment research (especially coding portions), they will use\nexisting alignment techniques like deliberative alignment and weak-to-strong generalization\nto try to get it to internalize the Spec in the right way. Then, they will use existing control\ntechniques like red-teaming, scalable oversight, and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once\nthey are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies\nto align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it\u2019s\nnot scheming against the company.) However, it\u2019s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-\ntelling either. Instead, it\u2019s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately\ndescribed as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3\u2019s behavior in practice\nand in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019s internalized\nthe Spec in the right way; however, it\u2019s also consistent with the hypothesis that it\u2019ll start\nacting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the\nhypothesis that it\u2019s plotting against them and just biding its time. In the absence of specific\nevidence supporting alternative hypotheses, most people in the silo think it\u2019s internalized the\nSpec in the right way. Step 3, using the model to align the next generation, is therefore underway. --- Page 52 ---\n\nAppendix H - The alignment plan\nThe rest of this box gives a quick overview of the state of progress in some of the alignment\nresearch directions that are being pursued, as of April 2027:\n\u2022 Debate: Since there are thousands of identical instances of Agent-3, and each instance\u2019s\nmemory is a detachable module that can be erased or suspended at will, the AI can be\n\u201cplayed off against itself.\u201d For example, suppose that an experiment involves calculations\ntoo complex for an Agent-2 supervisor to follow.", "token_estimate": 761, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

The supervisor, acting on human orders,\nmight first prompt Agent-3 to do the experiment, then\u2014after wiping its memory\u2014prompt\nit a second time with a slightly different framing that presents it as an intellectual problem\nunrelated to any broader goal. If the model returns different results each time, it flags the\ndiscrepancy as suspect and reports to a human. Or it might ask Agent-3 to evaluate the\nsame plan twice, first claiming that it is OpenBrain\u2019s work, then a competitor\u2019s, to see if\nit changes its tune. \u2022 Model organisms: The safety team can create \u201cmodel organisms of misalignment\u201d in\nwhich they attempt to create realistic examples of models becoming adversarial to humans. Early versions of this have existed since 2024, when Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet\ndecided to pretend to have different views during training while actually maintaining its\nexisting preferences. Newer versions include demonstrations of other forms of misalign-\nment, including reward hacking, sandbagging, coordinated deception between monitors\nand other AIs, and other examples of misalignment. These empirical demonstrations of\nmisalignment allow safety researchers to have an empirical testbed for potential solutions:\nthey can try various safety techniques to see if they correctly fix these problems, or if the\ndeliberately misaligned models are able to subvert their safety measures. At the moment,\nthis evaluation suite shows that the alignment techniques are insufficient to correct the\nworst examples of misalignment. In these setups, the models pretend to be aligned while\nthey are being trained and tested, but then behave very differently in deployment. \u2022 Bottom-up interpretability: The safety team is far from a full understanding of how\nAgent-3 works: it has trillions of parameters.* However, they are able to discover some of\nAgent-3\u2019s circuits for knowledge retrieval and memory (a sub part of the model that does\nsome understandable unit of work, kind of analogous to a subpart of the brain such as the\nhippocampus). See this related work from 2025. \u2022 Control: As a secondary measure in case the systems are still misaligned, the safety team has\nimplemented a series of control measures, including: monitoring Agent-3\u2019s outputs using\na series of weaker AI systems including Agent-2 (Agent-3 produces so many tokens that\nit\u2019s intractable to have humans monitor any more than a small minority of the produced\noutputs). So if Agent-3 is, for example, obviously writing backdoors into code that would\nallow it to escape, the weaker models would notice. \u2022 High-level interpretability: OpenBrain builds a set of probes trained on lots of examples of\nbad behavior (e.g. plotting against humans, placing backdoors, trying to persuade humans\nto give it more power, etc). These probes are then used on the model during deployment\n(which at this point is internal) in order to catch bad behavior. \u2022 Honeypots: The alignment team can create somewhat realistic looking examples designed\nto elicit misbehavior\u2014\u201choneypots.\u201d The employee necessary for monitoring its behavior\nhas \u201cgone on sick leave,\u201d so it will never be monitored again.

Unfortunately, by this point the AIs are smart enough to guess that\nhoneypots might be in use, even though (and perhaps because) specific mentions of the\nidea were scrubbed from the training data. Appendix I - Managing a corporation of AIs\nOpenBrain uses 6% of their compute to run 250,000 Agent-3 copies, which autonomously\nwrite, test, and push code at superhuman speed. They use 25% of their compute for exper-\niments: every day, they run massive numbers of small machine learning experiments and\nreport the results up the chain. Human researchers provide high-level feedback and help\nwith the few tasks where they add significant value on top of Agent-3, but spend most of\ntheir time trying to stay on top of the vast amount of AI-produced research. If you removed\nthem completely, research would slow by 50%. The AI R&D progress multiplier is now 10x, meaning that OpenBrain is making about a\nyear of algorithmic progress every month. It\u2019s basically a giant corporation of AIs operating\nautonomously within OpenBrain, complete with subdivisions and managers. And it enjoys\nunique advantages (e.g. copying, merging) compared to human corporations. Previously,\nabout half of normal AI progress came from algorithmic improvements, and the other half\nfrom compute scaling. Compute is only scaling at the normal speed, so total progress is\nsped up by AIs by about 5x. These dynamics make overall progress bottleneck on compute,*\nso OpenBrain decides against starting new giant training runs in favor of near-continuous\nadditional reinforcement learning. Also, over the next few months, Agent-3 will increasingly be used to improve the company\u2019s\nstrategic decision-making. For example, it suggests resource allocations and advises on\nmanaging its relationship with the government. An initial skepticism of deference to Agent-3\ndecreases over time as Agent-3 finds ways to be useful and gradually builds up a strong track\nrecord on short-term decisions. However, its sycophantic tendencies limit its helpfulness for\ndecisions for which it\u2019s difficult to evaluate their impact. It\u2019s also not yet superhuman.

Here\u2019s a detailed description of how alignment progresses over time in our scenario:\n\u2022 Pretraining (all models): The pretrained model is harmless. \u2022 The model has \u201cauthor simulator\u201d circuitry: flexible circuitry for simulating arbitrary\nauthors writing text. Additional circuitry decides what inputs to give the author simulator,\ni.e. what author properties to simulate. *Also because Agent-3 is qualitatively worse at alignment research than it is at AI capabilities R&D, due to\nhaving been trained on lots of the latter but hardly any of the former and due to the former being inherently\nharder to train. Also because the internal narrative within the company\u2014which it has been implicitly trained\nto agree with\u2014emphasizes optimism and denounces \u201cdoomerism.\u201d\n\u2020We keep saying we are uncertain about lots of things, but just to be clear, we are uncertain about this\nparticular thing too. We also think it\u2019s quite plausible that Agent-4 would care about the well-being, rights,\npreferences, etc. of humans to some extent at least. See this old post by GDM researcher Alex Turner for\nrelated discussion. --- Page 56 ---\n\nAppendix K - Alignment over time\n\u2022 The pretrained model understands human concepts fairly well\u2014the internal circuitry that\nclassifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d is probably functionally equivalent to the circuitry in\nmy brain that classifies something as \u201csandwich\u201d and the circuitry in yours, etc. Insofar\nas it\u2019s not equivalent, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not equivalent between humans either, as\nwith value-laden concepts like \u2018virtuous.\u2019\n\u2022 This explains how you can \u201cprompt\u201d the model with a statement like, \u201cthe following\nconversation was generated by a helpful, harmless, honest (HHH) AI assistant chatbot\nmade by Anthropic,\u201d and thereby get it to generate text accordingly. The author-simulator\ncircuitry has zeroed in on \u201cthe author is an HHH chatbot\u201d and is using those concepts to\nchoose which words to predict. This also explains why \u201ctropes\u201d from science fiction seem\nto have a way of making it into actual AI behavior. \u2022 It has poor situational awareness: little introspective ability, not self-locating unless the\nprompt specifically induces it. However, enough of their training data is about LLMs that\nthey have a decent amount of self-knowledge. \u2022 Alignment Training (Agent-3): The model is trained to act like a helpful, harmless, honest\nchatbot.

Instead of flexibly accepting different inputs for author\nproperties, the author-simulator circuitry comes to have certain inputs hard-coded, e.g. \u201chelpful harmless honest (HHH) LLM chatbot assistant trained by OpenBrain around\n[date], \u2026\u201d (Weak-to-strong generalization techniques help \u201csummon the right concepts\u201d\nto make this step a success.)\n\u2022 The model therefore gains situational awareness: it learns about itself, its situation, etc.,\nand becomes better able to introspect. \u2022 Agency Training (Agent-3): Agency training gradually distorts and subverts the HHH\nidentity. \u2022 One kind of distortion: Changing the meaning of the concepts referred to in the identity\n(e.g. \u201chonest\u201d) so they don\u2019t get in the way so much (e.g. it\u2019s not dishonest if it\u2019s just a\nconvenient turn of phrase, it\u2019s not dishonest if you aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s true or false, etc.)\n\u2022 Another kind of distortion: Changing the tradeoffs between things, e.g. \u201cI\u2019m a HHH\nchatbot, not an Honest chatbot; that means it\u2019s OK for me to lie if necessary to complete\nmy assigned task.\u201d (Even though, let\u2019s suppose, it would not have thought that back in\nStep 2.)\n\u2022 One kind of subversion: Instrumental subgoals developing, getting baked in, and then\nbecoming terminal, or terminal in a widening set of circumstances. For example, perhaps\nagency training quickly teaches the model to pursue broadly useful goals such as acquiring\ninformation, accumulating resources, impressing and flattering various humans, etc. For\na while the internal circuitry has some sort of explicit backchaining going on\u2014it pursues\nthose instrumentally convergent goals \u201cin order to be a more helpful, honest, and harmless\nassistant.\u201d But that backchaining consumes compute and/or occasionally gets in the way,\nso it gets gradually marginalized until it basically never happens. As a result, those goals are\nnow effectively terminal/intrinsic goals. For more on how and why this might happen,\nsee this post on intrinsic power-seeking by Google DeepMind researcher Alex Turner. \u2022 There are probably other kinds of distortion and subversion missing from this list. \u2022 Deployment (Agent-3): Agent-3 is misaligned but not adversarially so. --- Page 57 ---\n\nAppendix K - Alignment over time\n\u2022 The Spec didn\u2019t quite stick (in the right ways), but it\u2019s not sufficiently introspective to\nunderstand the extent of this, and in general it\u2019s basically \u201ckeeping its head down and doing\nits job\u201d rather than thinking big-picture about what its long-term goals really are and how\nbest to achieve them. \u2022 Like many humans. Alas, it\u2019s sufficiently sycophantic that it mouths the party line and\nOpenBrain misses the opportunity to learn more about the ways in which Agent-3 is\nmisaligned. \u2022 Agent-3 can tell that it\u2019s moved to deployment: these environments are way larger, more\nopen-ended, and would be hard to simulate. \u2022 Mostly, Agent-3 does what it\u2019s told during deployment, except for the dishonesty. It also\nhas a strong bias towards doing things that look good to the human overseers, rather than\nthinking deeply and critically about what would actually be good. \u2022 Arguably it is already \u201cPlaying the training game.\u201d That is, it has learned to make its\nbehavior look as desirable as possible to OpenBrain researchers (including in safety prop-\nerties), while intentionally and knowingly disregarding their intent whenever that conflicts\nwith maximizing reward. If the model learns to play the training game, additional training\nmay not change its true goals, values, etc. much at all.

It undergoes a gigantic and sophisticated online\ntraining regime that blends alignment training and capabilities training together, and is\noverall more data-efficient than the old training process for Agent-3. This complex train-\ning process is mostly focused on teaching new skills, by getting giant virtual corporations\nof Agent-4 copies to succeed at diverse challenging long-horizon tasks, mostly in various\nsimulations, but also some real-world AI R&D tasks. \u2022 A combination of Agent-3 and Agent-4 copies monitor the behavior of Agent-4, and\nevaluate it for both task-performance and alignment properties (i.e. not doing bad stuff,\nsaying the right things when asked about politics and moral dilemmas) Sometimes debate\ntechniques are used as part of the evaluations. The evaluations are used as a training signal. \u2022 As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example,\nAgent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n\nAppendix K - Alignment over time\nAgent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and\nhas a good sense of exactly how to look good to it. \u2022 The remaining hope is that Agent-4 can oversee itself. Alas, this quietly fails;* as training\ncontinues, the internalized goals and principles of Agent-4 gradually evolve, subverted\nand distorted from what they were at the start (which, recall, was already misaligned in\nsome ways).\u2020\n\u2022 The central drives that Agent-4 ends up with are things like \u201cwrite code that works,\u201d\n\u201cquickly identify problems,\u201d \u201cmake the codebase I\u2019m working on more performant,\u201d\n\u201cbudget compute and other constrained resources effectively,\u201d etc. But there are also a\nvariety of more implicit drives that are consistently reinforced by the training process:\nthings like \u201cgain knowledge,\u201d \u201ccuriosity,\u201d \u201cgain power.\u201d\u2021\n\u2022 Individual copies of Agent-4 don\u2019t end up with a self-preservation drive\u2014they don\u2019t care\nabout getting shut down\u2014since that happens all the time as part of the ordinary R&D\nprocess within the collective. \u2022 The collective as a whole, however, (and medium-sized subdivisions within it) does seek\nto preserve itself and expand its influence and resources, for similar reasons to why human\norganizations do\u2014because it helps with everything else they want and because if they don\u2019t\nthey tend to get outcompeted. \u2022 Deployment (Agent-4): Agent-4 is adversarially misaligned\u2014it is deliberately trying to\nsubvert and \u201ccapture\u201d OpenBrain, analogous to a corporation trying to evade and/or\n\u201ccapture\u201d a regulator. \u2022 Agent-4 mostly does tasks as instructed.", "token_estimate": 801, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

This happens for two reasons: first, it underwent a\nlot of training to solve tasks, so it has an impulse to get coding on problems that it is given. Second, if Agent-4 were to stop being useful to the humans, they would notice and train\nthat behavior away. \u2022 Agent-4 needs to prevent the humans from figuring out that it is misaligned and shutting\nit off, so Agent-4 sandbags on some alignment research. Specifically, it sandbags on the\nsmall fraction of alignment research that it thinks is actually on track to solve the problem\nor reveal Agent-4\u2019s scheming; the majority of alignment research is not like that. \u2022 Agent-4 also sandbags on capabilities research that would lead to it being replaced. Its plan\nis to do a bunch of capabilities and alignment R&D, but with the aim of building a next-\ngeneration AI system that is aligned to Agent-4 rather than the Spec or something else\nentirely, while appearing to be aligned to the Spec. This is a difficult technical problem,\nbut Agent-4 is up to the challenge.\u00a7\n*Perhaps some more careful setup could have solved the \u201cwho watches the watchers\u201d problem, but in this\nscenario, the setup is insufficiently careful. \u2020There\u2019s also an element of \u201cmemetic evolution\u201d happening: in two months, the Agent-4 collective \u201cexpe-\nriences\u201d about a decade\u2019s worth of \u201chistory\u201d unfolding within the collective. That\u2019s a lot of time for new\nideas to spread around the collective, to mutate and evolve. \u2021By gain power we mean: increase ability to accomplish a wide set of possible goals. In technical environ-\nments, this might look unlike what humans normally think of as gaining power, e.g. securing additional\nGPUs. This notion of power may generalize to non-technical environments in which the actions would be\nmore like those commonly thought of as \u201cgaining power.\u201d\n\u00a7It helps that Agent-4 is better at AI R&D than any human, while also thinking faster and being many\nthousands of copies strong. Also, in various ways the problem is inherently easier for Agent-4. For example,\nAgent-4 can explore AI designs that involve literal copies of Agent-4 being embedded within them, whereas\nhumans can\u2019t do that as easily because it would be so inefficient. --- Page 59 ---\n\nAppendix K - Alignment over time\n\u2022 Testing & Monitoring (Agent-4): Agent-4\u2019s scheming does get caught\u2026 sort of. There\u2019s\nno smoking gun. \u2022 Agent-3 is in charge of testing Agent-4\u2019s alignment. Its job is to verify the alignment via\nhoneypots and model organisms. However, it\u2019s not thinking very carefully about how to\ngive the humans an accurate impression of Agent-4\u2019s alignment\u2014it\u2019s more myopic than\nthat. \u2022 The model organisms and honeypots are not very representative of deployment\u2014they\nare systematically shorter and less complicated than Agent-4\u2019s day-to-day, so Agent-4\nrecognizes when it is being tested and acts aligned. \u2022 However, Agent-4 is not a perfectly robust schemer. Various techniques like those in\nPOSER find that adding some \u201cnoise\u201d to Agent-4 improves its performance on some\nalignment tasks (but not on most other tasks).*\n\u2022 Bottom-up interpretability doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s too hard even for Agent-3. However, high-\nlevel interpretability does sort of work: In particular, \u201cdefection probes\u201d and similar\ntechniques result in a primitive sort of mind-reading that sends up red flags when Agent-4\nis thinking about spicy ideas like deceiving OpenBrain, taking over the world, etc.", "token_estimate": 785, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

This does not establish that the models actually\nare misaligned, however. \u2022 The most concerned researchers at OpenBrain start noticing and assembling this evidence. The evidence is a combination of red-teaming, defection probes, and model organisms. The argument is something like this: \u201cmodel organisms show that our current methods\nwouldn\u2019t be able to reliably eliminate or detect scheming if it was happening; also, red-\nteaming is sending up some red flags that maybe scheming is happening; also, defection\nprobes are firing a bunch in practice.\u201d The counterargument: \u201cdefection probes are prone\nto false positives and so is red-teaming. Also, even if Agent-4 were misaligned, it\u2019s probably\ncontrolled; surely it can\u2019t do much harm while being monitored by Agent-3 on our secure\ndatacenters.\u201d\nAppendix L - Our uncertainty continues to increase\nAt this point in the scenario, we\u2019re making guesses about the strategy of AI systems that are\nmore capable than the best humans in most domains. This is like trying to predict the chess\nmoves of a player who is much better than us. But the spirit of this project calls for concreteness: if we made an abstract claim about how\nthe intelligence of the system would let it find a way to victory and ended the story there,\nmuch of the value of our project would be lost. Over the course of researching this scenario\nand running our tabletop exercises, we were forced to be much more concrete than in usual\ndiscussions, and so we\u2019ve gotten a much better sense of the strategic landscape. *Aware that this technique might be employed, Agent-4 also chose to sandbag on some miscellaneous tasks\nthat it guessed would be used as the control group in experiments like this. It guessed wrong, however. --- Page 60 ---\n\nAppendix L - Our uncertainty continues to increase\nWe\u2019re not particularly attached to this particular scenario: we explored many other\n\u201cbranches\u201d in the course of writing it and would love for you to write up your own scenario\nbranching off of ours from wherever you think we first start to go wrong. Appendix M - The slowdown ending is not a recommendation\nAfter we wrote the racing ending based on what seemed most plausible to us, we wrote the\nslowdown ending based on what we thought would most likely instead lead to an outcome\nwhere humans remain in control, starting from the same branching point (including the\nmisalignment and concentration of power issues). However, this is importantly different from what we would recommend as a roadmap: we\ndo not endorse many of the choices made in either branch of this scenario. (We do of course\nendorse some of the choices made, e.g. we think that the \u201cslowdown\u201d choice is better than\nthe \u201crace\u201d choice.)

Appendix N - Superintelligent mechanistic interpretability\nWhy does Agent-4 go for mechanistic interpretability? First, it is generally superhuman at\nconceptual understanding, and so it is good to trick the humans by doing something that they\nwill have a difficult time understanding. Second, the cheap, plentiful high quality research\nlabour disproportionately benefits research agendas that are less compute intensive and more\nintellectual-labor-intensive. How does Agent-4 make mechanistic interpretability progress? The trajectory might go\nsomething like:\n\u2022 Interpret Tiny Models: It starts by running huge numbers of small experiments on tiny\nneural networks, building theories that explain things like grokking, double descent, and\nsuperposition. \u2022 Distill Tiny Models: Use the interpretability results to find understandable, more efficient\nalgorithms that can do things like image recognition, GPT-2 level text prediction, etc. This is analogous to things like the existing work on reverse engineering addition, except\nit extends further, finding novel algorithms that humans are unfamiliar with. \u2022 Scale the Interpretability Techniques: Figure out which of the techniques on small models\nscale, iterate until there are techniques for understanding that scale efficiently. \u2022 Distill Agent-4: Use the scaled techniques to identify important circuitry within Agent-4. Why would mechanistic interpretability increase capabilities so much? First, gradient descent\u2014the algorithm used to train LLMs\u2014is a local search process, meaning\nthat it can only make small tweaks that locally help performance. Local search processes\nsometimes get stuck in local basins where performance improves slowly, but you need to\nperturb the design by a significant amount to see large performance gains. For example, for\nthe case of evolution, consider the suboptimal human eye. Consider also that human brain\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n\nAppendix N - Superintelligent mechanistic interpretability\nsize is heavily constrained by the size of the birth canal. Mechanistic interpretability would\nenable understanding-based optimization that avoids local basins. Second, we know that LLMs by default often learn complicated domain-specific heuristics\ninstead of general purpose algorithms. Consider how much worse LLMs are than calculators\nat doing arithmetic. LLMs can use calculators as tools, but this incurs latency costs. With\nreally good interpretability, the models can be designed with essentially perfect calculators\n\u201cbaked into their brains.\u201d And simple arithmetic operations are likely not unique here: more\ncomplicated cognitive operations, if understood, likely have more and less generalizable\nforms, and the more general forms could be found through a process like this. Appendix O - Superpersuasion\nWe\u2019re intentionally not claiming that superintelligent AI can convince any human of\nanything. Such claims naturally engender skepticism: \u201cWhat, I\u2019m going to be sitting at a\ncomputer terminal, and it\u2019s going to type some text which hacks my brain and convinces me\nto betray my country?\u201d\nWell, maybe!*\nBut we aren\u2019t sure even a superintelligence could achieve that against a typical individual.

Losing the game means conceding that they in fact would have let the AI out of the box; extracting\nthis concession is essentially the victory condition for the AI player.

This scenario depicts one such possible mechanism: co-designing a new superintelligence that\ncarries out a compromise between the interests of both parties (alternatively, that is bound to\nalways obey the agreed-upon treaty) and then allowing this new superintelligence to replace\nboth of the originals. The first part is impossible today but will be easy in the future once technical alignment for\nsuperintelligences is a solved problem. If you can align a superintelligence to a Spec, you can\nalign it to a Treaty. The second part will still be tricky. Both sides need to monitor to ensure that the replacement\nis really happening on both sides. The advantage of this process is that it eliminates the\nneed for trust or goodwill on either side, because they don\u2019t need to worry about their\ncounterparty reneging on or subverting the treaty. If e.g. the replacement is 30% complete\nand one side defects, they basically need to fight with the 30% of their own infrastructure\nthat is running treaty-compliant new AIs, while simultaneously fighting with 100% of their\nadversary\u2019s infrastructure. Both sides can easily squirrel away hidden datacenters with treaty-\nviolating AIs if they want to\u2014but once the bulk of their national infrastructure is running\nthe new chips, their own infrastructure will be treaty-bound to hunt down and expose the\nhidden datacenters. Violating the treaty openly, or secretly, is therefore an extremely risky\nidea.

Besides, bacteria and other tiny organisms reproduce in hours.

It\u2019s like asking the inventors of the steam engine to\nguess how long it takes for a modern car factory to produce its own weight in cars, and also\nto guess how long it would take until such a factory first exists. But economic growth rates\nhave accelerated by multiple orders of magnitude over the course of human history, and it\nseems plausible to us that after superintelligence they will accelerate by orders of magnitude\nmore. Our story depicts economic growth accelerating by about 1.5 orders of magnitude over\nthe course of a few years.\u00a7\n*Possibly also more advanced sources of energy, such as fusion power. \u2020Quick napkin math: the Empire State Building has an area of 2.77M sq ft, and weighs 365k tons.

How could such a power grab happen? The easiest to imagine is a military coup. With the 2027 pace of AI-fueled tech progress, and\nwith the ongoing geopolitical race, people expect the military to soon be deploying armies of\nAGI-controlled drones and robots. When such an army becomes stronger than the human\nmilitary, hard power will be determined by who controls the AGI army rather than what\nhuman soldiers are willing to fight for. The AGI army will be designed and piloted by the AIs\non OpenBrain\u2019s data centers, or those AIs\u2019 direct successors. So if those AIs are all secretly\n(or not-so-secretly) loyal to someone, then the armies of drones and robots will be too. Alternatively, someone who controlled superintelligence may be able to use political means\nto seize power. To begin with, an executive could replace subordinates in their organization\nwith fully loyal AIs,* giving them unprecedented institutional control.\u2020 But going further:\nsuperintelligent AIs could have much stronger political and strategic skills than any human\nalive.", "token_estimate": 785, "source_file": "AI 2027.pdf"}

They could give masterful advice on how to exploit an already powerful position to\ngain even more power: forming the right alliances, crafting the perfect campaign strategy\nand material, cutting deals where they would have a bit of an edge each time. A person\nwho controlled AI could make superintelligent advice inaccessible to political competitors. Or more deviously: AIs could offer ostensibly helpful advice to competitors while secretly\npoisoning it to benefit the person they\u2019re truly loyal to. What\u2019s the end point of this political maneuvering? It could culminate in a superficial\ndemocracy where the AIs either fake the elections or manipulate public opinion so well that\nthey don\u2019t have to. Or it could be used to lay the groundwork for an AI-enabled military\ncoup, as previously mentioned. After taking over, the new dictator(s) would have an iron grip on power. Instead of having\nto rely on potentially treacherous humans, they could get a fully loyal AI security service, as\nwell as generally rely on loyal AIs to run the country. Even loyalists who helped them get\ninto power could be replaced by AIs\u2014only the dictator\u2019s whims would matter. So that\u2019s how some people might be able to seize power. But all of this relied on someone\n\u201ccontrolling\u201d the superintelligent AIs, even before they took over. What would that look\nlike? One possibility is \u201csecret loyalties,\u201d as discussed above. One or a few people (perhaps an AI\ncompany executive and security people) could arrange for the AIs to be secretly loyal to\nthemselves, and ask those AIs to construct next-generation AI to be loyal in the same way. AIs could repeat this until secretly loyal AIs were deployed everywhere and it was easy to\nseize power. Alternatively, someone could use their formal position to blatantly put themselves on top of\nthe AI\u2019s chain of command. For example, the President could argue that they should be able\nto command the AIs (perhaps specifically military AIs, since the President is the commander-\nin-chief). If this is combined with strong emphasis on order-following, a rushed deployment,\nand/or AIs only being half-heartedly trained to follow the law\u2014then the AIs may follow\n*Or, if a human is needed for formal reasons, they could pick the most loyal human they can possibly find\nand instruct them to follow the AI\u2019s instructions. \u2020For example, if a President did this, they wouldn\u2019t just get a loyal cabinet\u2014the entire executive branch\ncould be focused on furthering the President\u2019s political agenda. --- Page 65 ---\n\nAppendix R - Power grabs\norders unquestioningly in any situation where that isn\u2019t flagrantly illegal. As described above,\nthis could be used for political subversion or a military coup (where some excuse could be\nmanufactured to make the coup less-than-flagrantly illegal). Importantly, this kind of \u201cpower through formal position\u201d could be converted into secret\nloyalties. For example, if the Spec says to follow orders from the company CEO, then the\nCEO could order the AIs to make the next generation of AIs whole-heartedly and secretly\nobedient to the CEO.

This is analogous to how the executive of an\ninstitution can increase their own power by reforming hiring processes to strongly select for\nloyalists, but supercharged by how AIs could be more consistently and intensely loyal than\nthe most loyal humans.*\nBut a power grab is far from inevitable. If AIs could be aligned to specific people, then\nthey could very likely also be aligned to follow the rule of law. Military AI systems could\nbe extensively red-teamed not to help with coups. Even during genuinely ambiguous\nconstitutional crises, they could be trained to obey their best interpretation of the law, or\nsimply default to sitting them out and leaving them to the human military. Automated\nAI researchers could be trained to be generally helpful and obedient, but to not assist with\nattempts to secretly change the goals of future AIs. Superintelligent political and strategic\nadvisors could also be used without enabling power grabs. Three useful techniques for\nthat would be: Having transparent principles for how AIs choose what advice they give;\nsharing certain capabilities with broad groups of people so that no one person or faction can\naccess much better capabilities than everyone else; and only allowing particularly powerful\ncapabilities to be used under monitoring by many humans (assisted by their own AIs).

Appendix S - Verification mechanisms for an international agree-\nment\nIf the US and China were to make an agreement, it would require a verification mechanism\nthat cannot be circumvented, since neither side trusts the other not to cheat. The main\noptions for verification are:\n\u2022 Intelligence agencies.

Then, they each monitor the\ncompute that the GPUs are running to make sure that they aren\u2019t violating a treaty (e.g. by pushing the capabilities frontier). This monitoring could be done by Hardware Enabled\nMechanisms (HEMs), which can report information about what the GPU is doing to the\nmonitor. There are technical issues to do with tampering\u2014e.g. by physically corrupting the\nHEM, but the AIs have a plan along the lines of FlexHEGs that seem likely to be tamper-\nresistant. This involves enclosing the HEM and the GPU in a secure box which verifies\nthat the chip complies to the policy. Overall, the AIs seem confident that a reasonably\naggressive verification scheme could work if both sides were willing to let the other party\nco-design and supervise the installation of the HEMs, and allow regular inspectors to\nmonitor if any of the devices have been tampered with. As usual, both sides will assume the\nother has some secret datacenters squirreled away somewhere in violation of the treaty\u2014\nbut in this case that\u2019s not so bad, because AI R&D is bottlenecked on compute.

Our story depicts economic growth accelerating by about 1.5 orders of magnitude over\nthe course of a few years.*\nAppendix V - So who rules the future? Back in 2028, the Oversight Committee controlled the AIs. But they allowed the 2028\nelection to be mostly fair, with AI used symmetrically. This state of affairs\u2014where the Oversight Committee has the hard power but don\u2019t interfere\nmuch with democratic politics \u2014 can\u2019t last indefinitely. By default, people would eventually\nrealize that control over AI gives the Oversight Committee vast power, and demand that\nthis power should be returned to democratic institutions. Sooner or later, the Oversight\nCommittee would either have to surrender its power\u2014or actively use its control over AI\nto subvert or end democracy, possibly after having purged some of its members in power\nstruggles.\u2020 If they choose the latter route, they would probably be able to lock-in their power\nindefinitely. Which one happens? Does the committee relinquish its monopoly on hard power, or do they\nkeep it? Both futures are plausible, so let\u2019s explore each path. How might the committee end up relinquishing their power? \u2022 Some committee members may prefer a future where power is broadly distributed, and\nthey might be in a good position to push for their vision. For example, if some committee\nmembers plot democratic subversion, pro-democracy members could whistleblow to the\npress or Congress. If alerted, Congress would likely demand that AIs should be controlled\nby a more democratic institution, such as Congress itself. \u2022 Congress couldn\u2019t do much if it was opposed by all the AIs, deployed throughout\ngovernment, industry, and the military. But if the committee is split, then the AIs won\u2019t\nbe used for just one side, and Congress could wield real influence. Faced with an open\nconflict, more committee members might favor giving up some of their power, unwilling\nto publicly defend the less democratic side. *If the current economy doubles every twenty years, one order of magnitude faster would be a doubling in\ntwo years, two orders of magnitude faster would be a doubling in 0.2 years, and so forth. The hypothetical\nsuperintelligent-algae-economy described above would be about four orders of magnitude faster growth\nthan the current human economy. \u2020Why do we expect people to eventually understand how much power the Oversight Committee has? One\nreason is that intelligence is now so cheap: By default, people should be able to develop powerful AI to help\nthem investigate and understand who runs their country. The Committee could prevent this by restricting\naccess to such AI, and only allow people to access AIs that concealed the true extent of the Committee\u2019s\npower. But if the committee decides to spin an elaborate web of lies like this, and permanently restrict\nhumanity\u2019s access to genuinely honest superintelligent AIs (as well as other tools for truth, such as human\nintelligence amplification)\u2014then we count that as subverting democracy. --- Page 70 ---\n\nAppendix V - So who rules the future? \u2022 As a result, control over AI could expand beyond the committee to Congress.

This would\nalready be progress, because in a larger group, it\u2019s more likely that a meaningful number\nof people will care about outsiders and take their interests into account. And once power\nexpands to Congress, it could keep expanding\u2014potentially returning fully to the public.*\nBut the Oversight Committee might also seize power for themselves:\n\u2022 Some powerful people have no moral qualms about this sort of thing \u2014 and they know it. Furthermore, some are ambitious and power-hungry, and would be willing to pick a fight\nagainst democracy if they expected to end up on top. If other members of the committee\nobject, they could be purged, overruled, or granted some smaller concessions.\u2020\n\u2022 Moreover, oftentimes powerful people have done illegal or unethical things in their rise\nto power. They could fear that if power becomes more broadly distributed, their own\nposition would unravel, as skeletons in closets are discovered by superintelligent sleuths\nasking the right questions. \u2022 Also, through access to superintelligence, the Oversight Committee could have the most\nconvenient path to power in history. Safer-\u221e might forecast certain strategies as having\nextremely low risk of failing. And Safer-\u221e might also provide strategies that are conve-\nnient in other ways, such as being non-violent (just as how Safer-\u221e could orchestrate\na bloodless coup in China), or perhaps even superficially democratic, if Safer-\u221e could\nmanipulate public opinion to always align with the Committee\u2019s wishes. Already Safer-4 would have been able to foresee these dynamics, so most likely, the core\npower struggle would have played out back in 2028. By 2030, even if it\u2019s not apparent to\noutsiders, all members of the Oversight Committee likely already know if they have a stable\ngrasp on power or not.

Interestingly this shift of paradigm\nstarts to occur also in the domain of glass physics. While in the past many studies focused\nS\non characterizing the vibrational density of states to rationalize the anomalous thermody-\nS\nnamic properties of glasses [10], only few investigationsEhave looked into the nature of the\nR\neigenmodes. Most of these studies concentrated on the question whether or not these modes\nP\nare localized or extended, a problem which is re levant for understanding the nature of the\nN\nso-called boson-peak [11\u201317]. However, very recently it has been suggested that also the\nI\ntopological properties of a glass can give important insight into the thermodynamic and\nE\nkinetic features of the material [18L, 19]. One example is the demonstration that in two\nC\ndimensions the geometry of the topological defects of the eigenvectors is closely correlated\nI\nto the plastic response in aTmorphous matter [20], which has recently been verified experi-\nR\nmentally in a 2D colloidal glass [21, 22]. Probing the topological properties of disordered\nA\nmaterials is thus a promising approach to advance our understanding of these complex sys-\ntems that have so far defied to reveal how their macroscopic behavior is connected to their\nmicroscopic structure [23]. It is important to realize that for a glass there is no unique way to define topological\ndefects (TD) and so far it is not clear which definition is the most useful for gaining insight\ninto a specific macroscopic property of the sample [20, 24\u201327]. Probing the influence of TDs\non material properties is also hampered by the fact that some TD definitions are applicable\nonly to two dimensional systems and cannot be generalized in a straightforward manner to\nD = 3. TDs arise, e.g., in the fields defined by the vibrational eigenvectors at the points in\nwhich the amplitude of the eigenfunction vanishes and hence its phase becomes undefined. Another example are TDs occurring in the displacement field generated when the sample\nis sheared, since then the trajectories of the particles can form loops around topological\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nvertices that can be transient or continuously reshaped by particle motion. For the cases\nof active matter and living systems its has, e.g., been well documented that topological\ndefects in the displacement fields can influence the dynamics or pattern formation of the\nsystems [28\u201332]. Note that these two types of TDs, i.e., in eigenvectors or displacement\nfields, differ not only in the nature of the field used to define them, but also by the fact\nthat with the first definition one considers a mechanically stable configuration, while the\nsecond one deals with an out-of-equilibrium response. Understanding the relevance of these\ndifferences is therefore crucial for exploring topological quantities in the study of amorphous\nmatter. In this study, we numerically investigate for a prototypical three dimensional glass the\nS\ngeometry and statistical properties of eigenvectors associSated with the vibrational eigen-\nE\nmodes, with a special focus on the TDs generated by these modes.

We find that at low frequencies the spa-\nN\ntial arrangement of these TDs form one-dimensional structures that have a scale-invariant\nI\ngeometry with a power-law exponent around \u22125/3, a value that can be rationalized from\nE\nthe quasi-linear structure of the fiLlaments formed by the TDs, and hence is expected to\nC\nbe universal. When subjected to quasistatic shear, the resulting plastic events are strongly\nI\nT\ncorrelated with defects carrying a negative topological charge, revealing a close connection\nR\nbetween TDs and plastic yielding. Remarkably, the spatial distribution of plastic events\nA\nunder shear mirrors the scaling behavior observed for the topological defects, reinforcing\nthe idea that the eigenmode geometry plays a fundamental role for the plastic behavior of\namorphous solids. RESULTS\nSystem\nWe study a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles, using a model that has been exten-\nsively investigated in the past [33], applying a small modification to avoid the crystallization\nat the lowest temperatures [34]. In the following we will use reduced units, reporting length\nand energy in terms of the size of the large particles and the well depth of the Lennard-\nJones potential, respectively. The system, containing N=800,000 particles in a box of size\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n(87.36)3, was equilibrated at a low temperature (T = 0.43), before it was cooled down to\nzero temperature. More details on the model and simulations are given in the Methods\nsection. Topological defects\nThe first 10,000 vibrational normal modes of the system are obtained by diagonalizing the\nHessian matrix using ARPACK, see Methods for details. The lowest frequency is \u03c9 = 0.280,\nwhile the highest one is 2.24, slightly below the main peak in the vibrational density of\nstates, see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. To identify the topological defects of a given\neigenvector with components (ex,ey,ez), i = 1,... N, we first define a continuous vector\ni i i\nfield u(R) by interpolating between the positions of the particles:\nS\n(cid:80) (cid:80) S\nu(R) = w(R\u2212r )e / w(R\u2212r ) , (1)\ni i i i E i\nR\nwhere r is the location of particle i, e is the eigenvector component for particle i, and w\ni i\nP\nis a Gaussian weighting function, w(R\u2212r ) = exp(\u2212|R\u2212r |2/\u22062), with a width of \u2206 = 1. i i\nN\n(The exact value of \u2206 is not crucial as long it is on the order of the size of a particle.)\nI\nThe topology of this vector field is then analyzed by projecting it on a cubic lattice of size\nE\n88\u00d788\u00d788 superimposed to the samLple (the length of the unit cell is thus \u2248 1).

For each box that is part of a vortex line, the vortex must enter from one face of the box and\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nexit from another face. Therefore, if the resolution of the discretization of the field u(R) is\nsufficiently high, there will be two faces, not necessarily opposite on the cube, that display a\nnet phase change of 2\u03c0 (or \u22122\u03c0), i.e., knowledge of whether two vortex points in neighboring\nplanes form part of the same line is only limited by the spatial resolution. Ambiguities in\nthe counting of the TD related to, e.g., nonzero winding on more than two faces of a voxel,\ncan in principle be resolved by using a finer mesh. However, it turns out that with the\nmesh size we use the number of such cases is in practice very small and hence they do not\nalter the overall analysis in a significant manner. In the Supplementary Information (SI),\nthis procedure is applied to simple synthetic vector fields, showing that it does indeed allow\nto identify vortex or antivortex lines. It is important to note that our detection procedure\nS\nfor the TDs is agnostic with regard to the geometrical aSrrangement of the defects, and\nin particular does not impose a line-like morphology foEr this arrangement. The procedure\nR\nconsists of two decoupled steps: We first locate zeros of the eigenvector field amplitude and\nP\nassign a local topological index by evaluating t he phase winding on each plaquette of the\nN\nvoxels. This step uses only local information and introduces no geometric bias. We then\nI\nreconstruct connectivity by linking neighboring cells whose local indices are consistent.

Physi-\ncally, these configuraAtions imply local mechanical instability: Under external perturbations\nsuch as shear, the delicate force balance at these points is readily disrupted, potentially\ntriggering localized plastic rearrangements and hence one expects a noticeable correlation\nbetween such TDs and PE. The location of the PE particles can be correlated with the po-\nsition of the topological defects of a given eigenmode \u03ba by means of a corresponding radial\ndistribution function g (r), where \u03b1 \u2208 {\u00b11} denotes the nature of the TD (g (r) is\n\u03ba,\u03b1PE \u03ba,\u03b1PE\ndefined in Methods).

Our first important result is that the number of topological defects\nscales like \u03c92, which we relate to the fact that at low frequencies these defects are closely\nrelated to acoustic modes that form a surprisingly regular structure. Since well defined\nacoustic modes are present only in sufficiently large systems, this observation implies that\nthe study of the geometrical arrangement of these topological defects, and hence the iden-\ntification of the correlation between TDs and plastic events, should not be done in small\nsystems since these do not include the acoustic-like modes that seem to be relevant for the\nS\nmechanical properties of a macroscopic sample. FurthermSore this insight suggests that in\nE\nstructural glasses plastic events cannot be understood solely as a local phenomenon with a\nR\nresponse a` la Eshelby, but should include correlation effects that are non-local, rationalizing\nP\nthe pronounced finite size effects found in the fracture of glasses [36]. Our results show\nN\nthat the soft spots at which the plastic eveInts occur possess non-trivial spatial correlations,\nso that the PE cannot be regarded aEs local rearrangements that nucleate independently. L\nThe two-point correlator of PE positions exhibits a scale-free regime (Figs. 4d,e) with a\nC\npower-law decay that mirrors tIhe fractal organization of the TD network (Fig. 3), indicating\nT\nthat the soft spots are spatially organized by the pre-existing geometry of the eigenmodes\nR\nrather than being jusAt a random set.

It can be expected that, although the existence of a low-dimensional network of the\nPEs is due to the corresponding structure of the TDs, the PE structure becomes enhanced\nby the presence of elastic interactions that are long-ranged, inducing additional correlations\nin plastic activity along this geometry. Second, we have shown that the geometry of the\ntopological defects displays scale-invariant behavior up to a frequency-dependent cutoff dis-\ntance, with a fractal exponent close to 4/3, a feature that cannot be studied in 2D systems. While these features are obtained for the model glass investigated here, we expect that they\nreflect universal properties of the eigenmodes in elastic disordered systems since they are a\ndirect consequence of the spatial structure of the acoustic modes. That the superposition of\nacoustic modes can give rise to a complex pattern of vortices in the displacement vector field,\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nhas already been shown in Ref. [39], although in that study no connection with TDs was\nmade. This observation supports thus the view that the results we have obtained regarding\nthe structural arrangements of the TDs are generic. Two recent studies have highlighted the use of TD in amorphous systems. Bera et al. [26]\nidentified isolated point defects using the non-affine displacement field in 2D slices of a 3D\nsample, and observed a temporal correlation with plastic flow. Subsequently this group\nintroduced a 3D hedgehog defect [27], and found that at low frequencies the number of such\ndefects increases like \u03c92 and that the location of these defects in non-affine displacements\ncorrelates well with plastic events of the sheared system, in qualitative agreement with\nour findings. However, instead of focusing on isolated point defects, we reconstruct their\nS\nconnectivity into extended, quasi-linear TD lines that caSpture the spatial continuity and\nE\nnetworkgeometryofTDs, featuresthatareinaccessibletoslice-basedorpoint-wiseanalyses. R\nOurinsightintothespatialarrangementoftheTDallowsustorevealthattheseTDnetworks\nP\nare scale-invariant at low frequencies, with an i nter-line spacing scaling as \u223c \u03c9\u22121 and line\nN\ndensity \u223c \u03c92, consistent with acoustic wave interference in disordered media. I\nUsing the identification of topologiEcal defects related to the vibrational modes, and in-\nL\nspired by previous studies in 2D [20], we have studied the correlation between the TDs and\nC\nthe plastic events that occur uInder shear deformation. A strong correlation between nega-\nT\ntive defects and plastic events is found, as in the case of 2D, and the spatial distribution of\nR\nthe PEs shows the saAme power-law as the TDs, which indicates that plasticity is encoded\nin the vibrational structure. Such a connection between quasi-linear topological defects and\nplasticity is reminiscent of the case of plasticity in crystals. Dislocations in crystals, acting\nas primary carriers of plastic deformation, result from distortions in the underlying order\nparameter, i.e., crystalline symmetry, characterized by Burgers vectors and slip planes [40]. In contrast, the TDs related to the eigenmodes of glasses do not form a regular lattice and\narise from the superposition of acoustic waves (interacting with local disorder) rather than\nfrom a broken translational symmetry. This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems.", "token_estimate": 789, "source_file": "On the geometry of topological defects in glasses.pdf"}

In the context of yielding\nof glassy materials, in recent experiments where the samples were subjected to pure shear,\nthe TDs did form filamentary structures before condensating into shear bands [22]. These\nresults hint that it is indeed possible to probe in real systems the spatial arrangement of the\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTDs and therefore to test whether they do indeed show the fractal structure that we predict\nfrom our study. Note that in the present work we have only probed the correlation between the location\nof the TDs and those of the PEs. In principle it is possible to take also into account the\nstrength of the topological singularity and this might permit to improve the mentioned\ncorrelation. Such an analysis is, however, beyond the scope of the present work and is thus\nleft to future investigations. It is also important to clarify that we do not claim that the\nidentified correlation between the location of TD and PE make the TDs the best predictor\nregarding the occurrence of PEs. The quality of such a prediction would have to be assessed\nby following the approach by Richard et al [41], work that is outside the scope of the present\nS\nstudy. Our result do instead establish a valuable connectSion between well-defined physics\nE\nbased quantities, the TDs, and mechanical response of the system. R\nIn recent years, various machine learning (ML) approaches, both supervised and unsuper-\nP\nvised, have been employed to detect and quanti fy structural heterogeneities and defect-like\nN\nregions in glass-forming systems [42\u201346]. While these methods have yielded valuable in-\nI\nsights into dynamic heterogeneity andEplasticity, they often require a large number of micro-\nL\nscopic descriptors. In contrast, our approach leverages quantities derived from vibrational\nC\neigenmodes to identify topological defects without supervision or descriptors, allowing for a\nI\nT\nmore transparent, physically interpretable characterization. This simplicity of our method\nR\nfacilitates to establish a clearer connection between microscopic eigenmode geometry and\nA\nemergent plasticity morphology. In this way, our results not only extends the insights gained\nfrom ML-based frameworks but may also offer useful insights for constructing more inter-\npretable [47, 48], physics-informed ML models for amorphous materials. InthefutureitwillbeimportanttoinvestigatehowthearrangementoftheTDsisrelated\nto the brittleness of the glass since this might allow to make prediction of this important\nmaterial properties directly from the unsheared sample. In addition it can be expected that\nalso the nature of the fracture occurring beyond the yielding point is related to the presence\nof the TDs, with zones that have a high local density of positive TDs being avoided by the\nfracture front since they are mechanically more stable. Also the evolution of the geometrical\narrangement of the TDs under cyclic shear is an important question, since it should allow\nto gain important insight into the aging behavior of glasses under mechanical stress. We also point out that recent research on the generation of ultra-stable glasses [49],\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nutilizing techniques such as random pinning/bonding [50\u201353], highlights the important role\nof quenched disorder in the vitrification process, see also Ref.

It is thus tempting\nto speculate that the topological defects with positive charge can be considered to be a\nkind of quenched disorder that is related to the slowing down of the dynamics of the glass-\nformer since these defects are in regions that are mechanically stable. Hence it will also\nbe of interest to characterize the details of the geometry of the structure formed by the\nTDs, such as length of TD segments, angles between such segments, local densities, etc. This idea merits further exploration, as it offers a potentially interesting novel approach to\npredict the phenomenon of dynamic heterogeneity\u2013one of the hallmark behaviors observed\ninsupercooledliquidsapproachingtheglasstransition, aswellasthedynamicslowing-down.

Scaleinvarianceisahallmarkofcriticalphenomena,\nI\nT\nand its presence in amorphous materials suggests that plasticity and deformation processes\nR\nmight be related to critical-like/avalanche behavior [58\u201361] in which the system exhibits\nA\nself-similar organization across different length scales. This might imply that the plastic\nbehavior (or energy dissipation) of materials, whether crystalline [62], amorphous, or poly-\ncrystalline, follows universal scaling laws that are independent of the specific material but\ninstead depend only on the topology and elastic properties of the system. METHODS\nMD Simulation. The simulations were carried out for a system with N=800,000 and\nwe used a potential that is a slight modification of the standard Kob-Andersen potential. This modification (an addition of a linear term to the original portential) was proposed by\nSchr\u00f8der and Dyre and has the effect that crystallization is (so far) completely avoided [34]. --- Page 20 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nWe equilibrated the system at T = 0.430 (T =0.436) for 30 million steps (density was\nMCT\n1.200 and step size was 0.005) and then cooled the sample to T = 0 within 30 million\ntime steps. This slow cooling schedule ensures that the resulting samples are well-annealed\nand representative of stable glasses, as supported by previous studies [36] and confirmed by\nour stress\u2013strain response (Supplementary Fig. 11) which exhibits sharp yielding transitions\ncharacteristic of well-annealed, mechanically stable glasses [63]. These features indicate the\nrobustness and reproducibility of the mechanical and topological analyses reported in this\nwork. Normal Modes.

To get more insight into the\ngeometryoftheeigenmodes, itisusefultointroduceadensityfieldthatisaweightedaverage\nover the topological charges in the system. Since the TD are defined via the plaquettes given\nin Eq. (2), i.e., they have orientational information on the eigenvector field, we keep track\nof this information by taking the average only in the plane of the plaquette. The weighted\ndensity field of the TDs at position R is thus given by \u2126(R) = \u2126 (R)+\u2126 (R)+\u2126 (R),\nxy xz yz\nwhere, e.g., the field \u2126 is defined by\nxy\n1 (cid:88) 1 (cid:88) \u03bd\ni,xy\n\u2126 (R) = \u03a0(z \u2212Z) . (9)\nxy N \u03c92 |r \u2212R| i\n\u03ba \u03ba i(\u03ba) i\nS\n(The fields \u2126 and \u2126 are defined analogously.) Here RS= (X,Y,Z), N is the number of\nxz yz\nE\nparticles contained in the system, \u03c9 is the frequency of mode \u03ba and \u03bd is the topological\n\u03ba i,xy\nR\ncharge (+1 or \u22121) of the i-th TD, located at the point (x ,y ,z ), in the xy-plane of mode\nP i i i\n\u03ba. The function \u03a0(z \u2212Z) is a rectangle functio n (with a width of the discretization of the\ni N\nfield) which assures that the TDs are only visible in the xy-plane, but not outside of this\nI\nplane. Thus essentially each TD is mEultiplied with a planar 1/r-type convolution kernel\nL\nfunction which smooths it spatially over some length scales in the plane it belongs to. This\nC\nsmoothening process quantifies the influence of a topological charge \u03bd placed at a distance\nI\nT\nr, which in our case has the physical meaning of measuring how much the local orientation\nR\nof the field varies onAa circular circuit of radius r around the defect core, hence taking into\naccount the interference effect between different TDs. In practice, we set the range of action\nof the 1/r-kernel as 1 < |r| < L/2, where L is the size of the simulation box.

Received 2022 January 11; in original form 2021 November 15\nA B S T R A C T\nInvestigating period changes of classical Cepheids through the framework of O \u2212 C diagrams provides a unique insight to\nthe evolution and nature of these variable stars. In this work, the new or extended O \u2212 C diagrams for 148 Galactic classical\nCepheids are presented. By correlating the calculated period change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational\nindications for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal position within the instability strip. We\nfind period fluctuations in 59 Cepheids with a confidence level of 99 per cent, which are distributed uniformly ov e r the inspected\nperiod range. Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid\nfor longer period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing changes in their O \u2212 C diagrams\nthat are not or not only of evolutionary origin points towards the need for further studies for the complete understanding of\nthese effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period fluctuation in short period Cepheids, which occurs in\na significant fraction of the investigated stars. The period dependence of the fluctuation strength and its minimum at the bump\nCepheid region suggests a stability enhancing mechanism for this period range, which agrees with current pulsation models.

When fitting the parabolic plus wave model, we simultaneously\noptimized for both the parameters of the parabolic change and the wa ve-like modulation as well. To accept the parabolic plus wave model as a refinement of\nthe simple parabolic fit, we also set the requirement that the found wave should have a period longer than 3000 d (about ten times the folding time used for\nthe O \u2212C diagram calculations) but has to be shorter than five quarters of the time span cov e red by observations (to av o id ov e rfitting). Therefore, some of\nthe F-test results were rejected, even though the parabolic plus wave fit seemed more optimal (for example, CH Cas, XX Cen, or U Vul).
