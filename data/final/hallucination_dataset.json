      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: This lattice\nC\nis subsequently used to identify the topological defects as follows, see Inset of Fig. 1: For\nI\neach of the six square sidesTof a cubic unit cell, we search for a signature of a topological\nR\ndefect by examining the structure of the phase of the field u(R), after having it projected\nA\non the square, on the border of the plaquette via a line integral. If this integral gives a net\nchange of ±2π one has a vortex or an anti-vortex, while a charge zero corresponds to a field\nwith no singularity. In practice we assign to each plaquette (having its corners at A, B, C,\nand D and being, e.g., in the xy-plane) a winding number ν defined as\nx,y\nθ θ\nD C\nν x,y ν x,y = [∆θ A,B +∆θ B,C +∆θ C,D +∆θ D,A ] mod 2π . (2)\nθ θ\nA B\nHere ∆θ is the change of the phase θ from point A to B, and the angle θ at point A\nA,B A\nis given by angle formed by the vector (ux,uy) with the x−axis. Each plaquette contains\nA A\neither a vortex, an anti-vortex, or it is neutral, if ν is equal to 1, −1, or 0, respectively. x,y\nThe search for topological defects is done for each of the six faces of the cubes of the lattice. For each box that is part of a vortex line, the vortex must enter from one face of the box and\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nexit from another face. Therefore, if the resolution of the discretization of the field u(R) is\nsufficiently high, there will be two faces, not necessarily opposite on the cube, that display a\nnet phase change of 2π (or −2π), i.e., knowledge of whether two vortex points in neighboring\nplanes form part of the same line is only limited by the spatial resolution. Ambiguities in\nthe counting of the TD related to, e.g., nonzero winding on more than two faces of a voxel,\ncan in principle be resolved by using a finer mesh. However, it turns out that with the\nmesh size we use the number of such cases is in practice very small and hence they do not\nalter the overall analysis in a significant manner. In the Supplementary Information (SI),\nthis procedure is applied to simple synthetic vector fields, showing that it does indeed allow\nto identify vortex or antivortex lines. It is important to note that our detection procedure\nS\nfor the TDs is agnostic with regard to the geometrical aSrrangement of the defects, and\nin particular does not impose a line-like morphology foEr this arrangement. The procedure\nR\nconsists of two decoupled steps: We first locate zeros of the eigenvector field amplitude and\nP\nassign a local topological index by evaluating t he phase winding on each plaquette of the\nN\nvoxels. This step uses only local information and introduces no geometric bias. We then\nI\nreconstruct connectivity by linking neighboring cells whose local indices are consistent. This\nE\nreveals the intrinsic dimensionalityLof the zero set: Isolated zeros remain point-like; if zeros\nC\ncontinue coherently across adjacent cells, a one-dimensional locus (TD line) emerges. I\nT\nIn Fig. 1 we show the number of topological defects per particle as a function of frequency\nR\nω. We observe that, aAt low ω, i.e., in the Debye-regime up to ω ≈ 1.0, one has the same ω2-\ndependencefoundina2Dsystem[20]. Thisresultindicatesthataslongasthesystemcanbe\nconsidered as an elastic continuum, the ω2-scaling between number of TDs and frequency\nis independent of the system dimension. To rationalize this ω2-dependence we show in\nFig.",

However, recently things have changed dramati-\ncally, since it has been realized that these functions contain important information about\nthe interference and superposition of quantum states, which allows to gain deep insight into\nthe properties of condensed quantum materials [4–9].

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In contrast, this arrangement has no direct\nanalogue in 2D systems, in which topological defects are point-like. As argued in Ref. [20], in\n2D the nature of the eigenvectors makes that the topological singularities are isolated points\nif the frequency is low. Thus these isolated zeros of the eigenvector field lack the extended\nconnectivity required to form filamentary or self-affine structures. With increasing ω the\nrange of scale-invariant behavior decreases, as indicated by the leveling-off of the correlation\nfunctions. The distance at which this leveling-off occurs defines a cross-over length ξ and\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n1 0 3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0\n1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0.259 1 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 -1 0.431 1 0 -1 1 0 -1 1 0.604 0 .2 5\n1 0 -2 0.776 1 0 -2 1 0 -2 0 .2 0\n0.949\n1 0 -3 1.121 1 0 -3 1 0 -3 0 .1 5\n1.294 0 .1 0\n1 0 -4 1 0 -4 1 0 -4\n1.466 0 .0 5\n1 0 -5 1 0 -5 1 0 -5 0 .0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 .0 0 .3 0 .6 0 .9 1 .2 1 .5 1 .8\nw ) ;r+( + g\na\n+ +\n~ r-5/3\n0.7\nr\nw ) ;r( -- g\nb\n--\n~ r-5/3\n0.259\n0.7 1.466\nr\nw ) ;r( -+ g\nc d\n+ - + +\n--\n+ -\n0.259 e\n0.7 1.466\nr\nxa\nmab\ng\nw\nw ~\nx /\n1\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nw\nS\nS\nFig. 3.

One finds that for ω < 0.604, this inverse\nlength scale, which can be interpreted as a wave-vector characterizing the spacing of the\nTDs lines, is proportional to ω, in agreement with the presence of the acoustic modes with\nthe ω2-scaling of the defects, as discussed above. We note that the slope of this linear part\nis given by the velocity of sound, supporting the view that at low ω this length scales is\ndirectly related to the acoustic modes. For intermediate frequencies one finds a much weaker\ndependence of ξ on ω, since in this ω-range one has a mixture between TDs lines that are\nwell separated and zones in which the TDs strongly interact (see Fig. 2)."

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: This lattice\nC\nis subsequently used to identify the topological defects as follows, see Inset of Fig. 1: For\nI\neach of the six square sidesTof a cubic unit cell, we search for a signature of a topological\nR\ndefect by examining the structure of the phase of the field u(R), after having it projected\nA\non the square, on the border of the plaquette via a line integral. If this integral gives a net\nchange of ±2π one has a vortex or an anti-vortex, while a charge zero corresponds to a field\nwith no singularity. In practice we assign to each plaquette (having its corners at A, B, C,\nand D and being, e.g., in the xy-plane) a winding number ν defined as\nx,y\nθ θ\nD C\nν x,y ν x,y = [∆θ A,B +∆θ B,C +∆θ C,D +∆θ D,A ] mod 2π . (2)\nθ θ\nA B\nHere ∆θ is the change of the phase θ from point A to B, and the angle θ at point A\nA,B A\nis given by angle formed by the vector (ux,uy) with the x−axis. Each plaquette contains\nA A\neither a vortex, an anti-vortex, or it is neutral, if ν is equal to 1, −1, or 0, respectively. x,y\nThe search for topological defects is done for each of the six faces of the cubes of the lattice. For each box that is part of a vortex line, the vortex must enter from one face of the box and\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nexit from another face. Therefore, if the resolution of the discretization of the field u(R) is\nsufficiently high, there will be two faces, not necessarily opposite on the cube, that display a\nnet phase change of 2π (or −2π), i.e., knowledge of whether two vortex points in neighboring\nplanes form part of the same line is only limited by the spatial resolution. Ambiguities in\nthe counting of the TD related to, e.g., nonzero winding on more than two faces of a voxel,\ncan in principle be resolved by using a finer mesh. However, it turns out that with the\nmesh size we use the number of such cases is in practice very small and hence they do not\nalter the overall analysis in a significant manner. In the Supplementary Information (SI),\nthis procedure is applied to simple synthetic vector fields, showing that it does indeed allow\nto identify vortex or antivortex lines. It is important to note that our detection procedure\nS\nfor the TDs is agnostic with regard to the geometrical aSrrangement of the defects, and\nin particular does not impose a line-like morphology foEr this arrangement. The procedure\nR\nconsists of two decoupled steps: We first locate zeros of the eigenvector field amplitude and\nP\nassign a local topological index by evaluating t he phase winding on each plaquette of the\nN\nvoxels. This step uses only local information and introduces no geometric bias. We then\nI\nreconstruct connectivity by linking neighboring cells whose local indices are consistent. This\nE\nreveals the intrinsic dimensionalityLof the zero set: Isolated zeros remain point-like; if zeros\nC\ncontinue coherently across adjacent cells, a one-dimensional locus (TD line) emerges. I\nT\nIn Fig. 1 we show the number of topological defects per particle as a function of frequency\nR\nω. We observe that, aAt low ω, i.e., in the Debye-regime up to ω ≈ 1.0, one has the same ω2-\ndependencefoundina2Dsystem[20]. Thisresultindicatesthataslongasthesystemcanbe\nconsidered as an elastic continuum, the ω2-scaling between number of TDs and frequency\nis independent of the system dimension. To rationalize this ω2-dependence we show in\nFig.",

However, recently things have changed dramati-\ncally, since it has been realized that these functions contain important information about\nthe interference and superposition of quantum states, which allows to gain deep insight into\nthe properties of condensed quantum materials [4–9].

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In contrast, this arrangement has no direct\nanalogue in 2D systems, in which topological defects are point-like. As argued in Ref. [20], in\n2D the nature of the eigenvectors makes that the topological singularities are isolated points\nif the frequency is low. Thus these isolated zeros of the eigenvector field lack the extended\nconnectivity required to form filamentary or self-affine structures. With increasing ω the\nrange of scale-invariant behavior decreases, as indicated by the leveling-off of the correlation\nfunctions. The distance at which this leveling-off occurs defines a cross-over length ξ and\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n1 0 3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0\n1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0.259 1 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 -1 0.431 1 0 -1 1 0 -1 1 0.604 0 .2 5\n1 0 -2 0.776 1 0 -2 1 0 -2 0 .2 0\n0.949\n1 0 -3 1.121 1 0 -3 1 0 -3 0 .1 5\n1.294 0 .1 0\n1 0 -4 1 0 -4 1 0 -4\n1.466 0 .0 5\n1 0 -5 1 0 -5 1 0 -5 0 .0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 .0 0 .3 0 .6 0 .9 1 .2 1 .5 1 .8\nw ) ;r+( + g\na\n+ +\n~ r-5/3\n0.7\nr\nw ) ;r( -- g\nb\n--\n~ r-5/3\n0.259\n0.7 1.466\nr\nw ) ;r( -+ g\nc d\n+ - + +\n--\n+ -\n0.259 e\n0.7 1.466\nr\nxa\nmab\ng\nw\nw ~\nx /\n1\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nw\nS\nS\nFig. 3.

One finds that for ω < 0.604, this inverse\nlength scale, which can be interpreted as a wave-vector characterizing the spacing of the\nTDs lines, is proportional to ω, in agreement with the presence of the acoustic modes with\nthe ω2-scaling of the defects, as discussed above. We note that the slope of this linear part\nis given by the velocity of sound, supporting the view that at low ω this length scales is\ndirectly related to the acoustic modes. For intermediate frequencies one finds a much weaker\ndependence of ξ on ω, since in this ω-range one has a mixture between TDs lines that are\nwell separated and zones in which the TDs strongly interact (see Fig. 2)."

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: This lattice\nC\nis subsequently used to identify the topological defects as follows, see Inset of Fig. 1: For\nI\neach of the six square sidesTof a cubic unit cell, we search for a signature of a topological\nR\ndefect by examining the structure of the phase of the field u(R), after having it projected\nA\non the square, on the border of the plaquette via a line integral. If this integral gives a net\nchange of ±2π one has a vortex or an anti-vortex, while a charge zero corresponds to a field\nwith no singularity. In practice we assign to each plaquette (having its corners at A, B, C,\nand D and being, e.g., in the xy-plane) a winding number ν defined as\nx,y\nθ θ\nD C\nν x,y ν x,y = [∆θ A,B +∆θ B,C +∆θ C,D +∆θ D,A ] mod 2π . (2)\nθ θ\nA B\nHere ∆θ is the change of the phase θ from point A to B, and the angle θ at point A\nA,B A\nis given by angle formed by the vector (ux,uy) with the x−axis. Each plaquette contains\nA A\neither a vortex, an anti-vortex, or it is neutral, if ν is equal to 1, −1, or 0, respectively. x,y\nThe search for topological defects is done for each of the six faces of the cubes of the lattice. For each box that is part of a vortex line, the vortex must enter from one face of the box and\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nexit from another face. Therefore, if the resolution of the discretization of the field u(R) is\nsufficiently high, there will be two faces, not necessarily opposite on the cube, that display a\nnet phase change of 2π (or −2π), i.e., knowledge of whether two vortex points in neighboring\nplanes form part of the same line is only limited by the spatial resolution. Ambiguities in\nthe counting of the TD related to, e.g., nonzero winding on more than two faces of a voxel,\ncan in principle be resolved by using a finer mesh. However, it turns out that with the\nmesh size we use the number of such cases is in practice very small and hence they do not\nalter the overall analysis in a significant manner. In the Supplementary Information (SI),\nthis procedure is applied to simple synthetic vector fields, showing that it does indeed allow\nto identify vortex or antivortex lines. It is important to note that our detection procedure\nS\nfor the TDs is agnostic with regard to the geometrical aSrrangement of the defects, and\nin particular does not impose a line-like morphology foEr this arrangement. The procedure\nR\nconsists of two decoupled steps: We first locate zeros of the eigenvector field amplitude and\nP\nassign a local topological index by evaluating t he phase winding on each plaquette of the\nN\nvoxels. This step uses only local information and introduces no geometric bias. We then\nI\nreconstruct connectivity by linking neighboring cells whose local indices are consistent. This\nE\nreveals the intrinsic dimensionalityLof the zero set: Isolated zeros remain point-like; if zeros\nC\ncontinue coherently across adjacent cells, a one-dimensional locus (TD line) emerges. I\nT\nIn Fig. 1 we show the number of topological defects per particle as a function of frequency\nR\nω. We observe that, aAt low ω, i.e., in the Debye-regime up to ω ≈ 1.0, one has the same ω2-\ndependencefoundina2Dsystem[20]. Thisresultindicatesthataslongasthesystemcanbe\nconsidered as an elastic continuum, the ω2-scaling between number of TDs and frequency\nis independent of the system dimension. To rationalize this ω2-dependence we show in\nFig.",

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In contrast, this arrangement has no direct\nanalogue in 2D systems, in which topological defects are point-like. As argued in Ref. [20], in\n2D the nature of the eigenvectors makes that the topological singularities are isolated points\nif the frequency is low. Thus these isolated zeros of the eigenvector field lack the extended\nconnectivity required to form filamentary or self-affine structures. With increasing ω the\nrange of scale-invariant behavior decreases, as indicated by the leveling-off of the correlation\nfunctions. The distance at which this leveling-off occurs defines a cross-over length ξ and\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n1 0 3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0\n1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0.259 1 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 -1 0.431 1 0 -1 1 0 -1 1 0.604 0 .2 5\n1 0 -2 0.776 1 0 -2 1 0 -2 0 .2 0\n0.949\n1 0 -3 1.121 1 0 -3 1 0 -3 0 .1 5\n1.294 0 .1 0\n1 0 -4 1 0 -4 1 0 -4\n1.466 0 .0 5\n1 0 -5 1 0 -5 1 0 -5 0 .0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 .0 0 .3 0 .6 0 .9 1 .2 1 .5 1 .8\nw ) ;r+( + g\na\n+ +\n~ r-5/3\n0.7\nr\nw ) ;r( -- g\nb\n--\n~ r-5/3\n0.259\n0.7 1.466\nr\nw ) ;r( -+ g\nc d\n+ - + +\n--\n+ -\n0.259 e\n0.7 1.466\nr\nxa\nmab\ng\nw\nw ~\nx /\n1\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nw\nS\nS\nFig. 3.

One finds that for ω < 0.604, this inverse\nlength scale, which can be interpreted as a wave-vector characterizing the spacing of the\nTDs lines, is proportional to ω, in agreement with the presence of the acoustic modes with\nthe ω2-scaling of the defects, as discussed above. We note that the slope of this linear part\nis given by the velocity of sound, supporting the view that at low ω this length scales is\ndirectly related to the acoustic modes. For intermediate frequencies one finds a much weaker\ndependence of ξ on ω, since in this ω-range one has a mixture between TDs lines that are\nwell separated and zones in which the TDs strongly interact (see Fig. 2)."

    "answer": "Rafael Moneo is renowned for his significant contributions to architecture rather than painting. One of his most notable projects is the Atocha train station renovation, which showcases his ability to blend modern design with historical context. Additionally, he worked on the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, which further solidified his reputation in the architectural community.\n\nMoneo's work has been recognized internationally, earning him the Pritzker Prize in 1996, a prestigious accolade in the field of architecture. His projects often reflect a deep understanding of urban identity and the complexities of modern life, as seen in his designs that resonate with the cultural fabric of Madrid.",

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In contrast, the TDs related to the eigenmodes of glasses do not form a regular lattice and\narise from the superposition of acoustic waves (interacting with local disorder) rather than\nfrom a broken translational symmetry. This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems. In the context of yielding\nof glassy materials, in recent experiments where the samples were subjected to pure shear,\nthe TDs did form filamentary structures before condensating into shear bands [22]. These\nresults hint that it is indeed possible to probe in real systems the spatial arrangement of the\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTDs and therefore to test whether they do indeed show the fractal structure that we predict\nfrom our study. Note that in the present work we have only probed the correlation between the location\nof the TDs and those of the PEs. In principle it is possible to take also into account the\nstrength of the topological singularity and this might permit to improve the mentioned\ncorrelation. Such an analysis is, however, beyond the scope of the present work and is thus\nleft to future investigations. It is also important to clarify that we do not claim that the\nidentified correlation between the location of TD and PE make the TDs the best predictor\nregarding the occurrence of PEs. The quality of such a prediction would have to be assessed\nby following the approach by Richard et al [41], work that is outside the scope of the present\nS\nstudy. Our result do instead establish a valuable connectSion between well-defined physics\nE\nbased quantities, the TDs, and mechanical response of the system. R\nIn recent years, various machine learning (ML) approaches, both supervised and unsuper-\nP\nvised, have been employed to detect and quanti fy structural heterogeneities and defect-like\nN\nregions in glass-forming systems [42–46]. While these methods have yielded valuable in-\nI\nsights into dynamic heterogeneity andEplasticity, they often require a large number of micro-\nL\nscopic descriptors. In contrast, our approach leverages quantities derived from vibrational\nC\neigenmodes to identify topological defects without supervision or descriptors, allowing for a\nI\nT\nmore transparent, physically interpretable characterization. This simplicity of our method\nR\nfacilitates to establish a clearer connection between microscopic eigenmode geometry and\nA\nemergent plasticity morphology. In this way, our results not only extends the insights gained\nfrom ML-based frameworks but may also offer useful insights for constructing more inter-\npretable [47, 48], physics-informed ML models for amorphous materials. InthefutureitwillbeimportanttoinvestigatehowthearrangementoftheTDsisrelated\nto the brittleness of the glass since this might allow to make prediction of this important\nmaterial properties directly from the unsheared sample. In addition it can be expected that\nalso the nature of the fracture occurring beyond the yielding point is related to the presence\nof the TDs, with zones that have a high local density of positive TDs being avoided by the\nfracture front since they are mechanically more stable. Also the evolution of the geometrical\narrangement of the TDs under cyclic shear is an important question, since it should allow\nto gain important insight into the aging behavior of glasses under mechanical stress. We also point out that recent research on the generation of ultra-stable glasses [49],\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nutilizing techniques such as random pinning/bonding [50–53], highlights the important role\nof quenched disorder in the vitrification process, see also Ref.

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In contrast, the TDs related to the eigenmodes of glasses do not form a regular lattice and\narise from the superposition of acoustic waves (interacting with local disorder) rather than\nfrom a broken translational symmetry. This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems. In the context of yielding\nof glassy materials, in recent experiments where the samples were subjected to pure shear,\nthe TDs did form filamentary structures before condensating into shear bands [22]. These\nresults hint that it is indeed possible to probe in real systems the spatial arrangement of the\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTDs and therefore to test whether they do indeed show the fractal structure that we predict\nfrom our study. Note that in the present work we have only probed the correlation between the location\nof the TDs and those of the PEs. In principle it is possible to take also into account the\nstrength of the topological singularity and this might permit to improve the mentioned\ncorrelation. Such an analysis is, however, beyond the scope of the present work and is thus\nleft to future investigations. It is also important to clarify that we do not claim that the\nidentified correlation between the location of TD and PE make the TDs the best predictor\nregarding the occurrence of PEs. The quality of such a prediction would have to be assessed\nby following the approach by Richard et al [41], work that is outside the scope of the present\nS\nstudy. Our result do instead establish a valuable connectSion between well-defined physics\nE\nbased quantities, the TDs, and mechanical response of the system. R\nIn recent years, various machine learning (ML) approaches, both supervised and unsuper-\nP\nvised, have been employed to detect and quanti fy structural heterogeneities and defect-like\nN\nregions in glass-forming systems [42–46]. While these methods have yielded valuable in-\nI\nsights into dynamic heterogeneity andEplasticity, they often require a large number of micro-\nL\nscopic descriptors. In contrast, our approach leverages quantities derived from vibrational\nC\neigenmodes to identify topological defects without supervision or descriptors, allowing for a\nI\nT\nmore transparent, physically interpretable characterization. This simplicity of our method\nR\nfacilitates to establish a clearer connection between microscopic eigenmode geometry and\nA\nemergent plasticity morphology. In this way, our results not only extends the insights gained\nfrom ML-based frameworks but may also offer useful insights for constructing more inter-\npretable [47, 48], physics-informed ML models for amorphous materials. InthefutureitwillbeimportanttoinvestigatehowthearrangementoftheTDsisrelated\nto the brittleness of the glass since this might allow to make prediction of this important\nmaterial properties directly from the unsheared sample. In addition it can be expected that\nalso the nature of the fracture occurring beyond the yielding point is related to the presence\nof the TDs, with zones that have a high local density of positive TDs being avoided by the\nfracture front since they are mechanically more stable. Also the evolution of the geometrical\narrangement of the TDs under cyclic shear is an important question, since it should allow\nto gain important insight into the aging behavior of glasses under mechanical stress. We also point out that recent research on the generation of ultra-stable glasses [49],\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nutilizing techniques such as random pinning/bonding [50–53], highlights the important role\nof quenched disorder in the vitrification process, see also Ref.

Two recent studies have highlighted the use of TD in amorphous systems. Bera et al. [26]\nidentified isolated point defects using the non-affine displacement field in 2D slices of a 3D\nsample, and observed a temporal correlation with plastic flow. Subsequently this group\nintroduced a 3D hedgehog defect [27], and found that at low frequencies the number of such\ndefects increases like ω2 and that the location of these defects in non-affine displacements\ncorrelates well with plastic events of the sheared system, in qualitative agreement with\nour findings.

I\nUsing the identification of topologiEcal defects related to the vibrational modes, and in-\nL\nspired by previous studies in 2D [20], we have studied the correlation between the TDs and\nC\nthe plastic events that occur uInder shear deformation. A strong correlation between nega-\nT\ntive defects and plastic events is found, as in the case of 2D, and the spatial distribution of\nR\nthe PEs shows the saAme power-law as the TDs, which indicates that plasticity is encoded\nin the vibrational structure. Such a connection between quasi-linear topological defects and\nplasticity is reminiscent of the case of plasticity in crystals. Dislocations in crystals, acting\nas primary carriers of plastic deformation, result from distortions in the underlying order\nparameter, i.e., crystalline symmetry, characterized by Burgers vectors and slip planes [40].

[39], although in that study no connection with TDs was\nmade. This observation supports thus the view that the results we have obtained regarding\nthe structural arrangements of the TDs are generic. Two recent studies have highlighted the use of TD in amorphous systems. Bera et al. [26]\nidentified isolated point defects using the non-affine displacement field in 2D slices of a 3D\nsample, and observed a temporal correlation with plastic flow. Subsequently this group\nintroduced a 3D hedgehog defect [27], and found that at low frequencies the number of such\ndefects increases like ω2 and that the location of these defects in non-affine displacements\ncorrelates well with plastic events of the sheared system, in qualitative agreement with\nour findings. However, instead of focusing on isolated point defects, we reconstruct their\nS\nconnectivity into extended, quasi-linear TD lines that caSpture the spatial continuity and\nE\nnetworkgeometryofTDs, featuresthatareinaccessibletoslice-basedorpoint-wiseanalyses.

I\nUsing the identification of topologiEcal defects related to the vibrational modes, and in-\nL\nspired by previous studies in 2D [20], we have studied the correlation between the TDs and\nC\nthe plastic events that occur uInder shear deformation. A strong correlation between nega-\nT\ntive defects and plastic events is found, as in the case of 2D, and the spatial distribution of\nR\nthe PEs shows the saAme power-law as the TDs, which indicates that plasticity is encoded\nin the vibrational structure. Such a connection between quasi-linear topological defects and\nplasticity is reminiscent of the case of plasticity in crystals. Dislocations in crystals, acting\nas primary carriers of plastic deformation, result from distortions in the underlying order\nparameter, i.e., crystalline symmetry, characterized by Burgers vectors and slip planes [40]. In contrast, the TDs related to the eigenmodes of glasses do not form a regular lattice and\narise from the superposition of acoustic waves (interacting with local disorder) rather than\nfrom a broken translational symmetry.

This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems. In the context of yielding\nof glassy materials, in recent experiments where the samples were subjected to pure shear,\nthe TDs did form filamentary structures before condensating into shear bands [22]. These\nresults hint that it is indeed possible to probe in real systems the spatial arrangement of the\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTDs and therefore to test whether they do indeed show the fractal structure that we predict\nfrom our study. Note that in the present work we have only probed the correlation between the location\nof the TDs and those of the PEs. In principle it is possible to take also into account the\nstrength of the topological singularity and this might permit to improve the mentioned\ncorrelation. Such an analysis is, however, beyond the scope of the present work and is thus\nleft to future investigations. It is also important to clarify that we do not claim that the\nidentified correlation between the location of TD and PE make the TDs the best predictor\nregarding the occurrence of PEs. The quality of such a prediction would have to be assessed\nby following the approach by Richard et al [41], work that is outside the scope of the present\nS\nstudy. Our result do instead establish a valuable connectSion between well-defined physics\nE\nbased quantities, the TDs, and mechanical response of the system. R\nIn recent years, various machine learning (ML) approaches, both supervised and unsuper-\nP\nvised, have been employed to detect and quanti fy structural heterogeneities and defect-like\nN\nregions in glass-forming systems [42–46]. While these methods have yielded valuable in-\nI\nsights into dynamic heterogeneity andEplasticity, they often require a large number of micro-\nL\nscopic descriptors. In contrast, our approach leverages quantities derived from vibrational\nC\neigenmodes to identify topological defects without supervision or descriptors, allowing for a\nI\nT\nmore transparent, physically interpretable characterization. This simplicity of our method\nR\nfacilitates to establish a clearer connection between microscopic eigenmode geometry and\nA\nemergent plasticity morphology. In this way, our results not only extends the insights gained\nfrom ML-based frameworks but may also offer useful insights for constructing more inter-\npretable [47, 48], physics-informed ML models for amorphous materials. InthefutureitwillbeimportanttoinvestigatehowthearrangementoftheTDsisrelated\nto the brittleness of the glass since this might allow to make prediction of this important\nmaterial properties directly from the unsheared sample. In addition it can be expected that\nalso the nature of the fracture occurring beyond the yielding point is related to the presence\nof the TDs, with zones that have a high local density of positive TDs being avoided by the\nfracture front since they are mechanically more stable. Also the evolution of the geometrical\narrangement of the TDs under cyclic shear is an important question, since it should allow\nto gain important insight into the aging behavior of glasses under mechanical stress. We also point out that recent research on the generation of ultra-stable glasses [49],\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nutilizing techniques such as random pinning/bonding [50–53], highlights the important role\nof quenched disorder in the vitrification process, see also Ref.

Two recent studies have highlighted the use of TD in amorphous systems. Bera et al. [26]\nidentified isolated point defects using the non-affine displacement field in 2D slices of a 3D\nsample, and observed a temporal correlation with plastic flow. Subsequently this group\nintroduced a 3D hedgehog defect [27], and found that at low frequencies the number of such\ndefects increases like ω2 and that the location of these defects in non-affine displacements\ncorrelates well with plastic events of the sheared system, in qualitative agreement with\nour findings. However, instead of focusing on isolated point defects, we reconstruct their\nS\nconnectivity into extended, quasi-linear TD lines that caSpture the spatial continuity and\nE\nnetworkgeometryofTDs, featuresthatareinaccessibletoslice-basedorpoint-wiseanalyses.

A strong correlation between nega-\nT\ntive defects and plastic events is found, as in the case of 2D, and the spatial distribution of\nR\nthe PEs shows the saAme power-law as the TDs, which indicates that plasticity is encoded\nin the vibrational structure. Such a connection between quasi-linear topological defects and\nplasticity is reminiscent of the case of plasticity in crystals.

This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems. In the context of yielding\nof glassy materials, in recent experiments where the samples were subjected to pure shear,\nthe TDs did form filamentary structures before condensating into shear bands [22]. These\nresults hint that it is indeed possible to probe in real systems the spatial arrangement of the\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTDs and therefore to test whether they do indeed show the fractal structure that we predict\nfrom our study. Note that in the present work we have only probed the correlation between the location\nof the TDs and those of the PEs. In principle it is possible to take also into account the\nstrength of the topological singularity and this might permit to improve the mentioned\ncorrelation. Such an analysis is, however, beyond the scope of the present work and is thus\nleft to future investigations. It is also important to clarify that we do not claim that the\nidentified correlation between the location of TD and PE make the TDs the best predictor\nregarding the occurrence of PEs. The quality of such a prediction would have to be assessed\nby following the approach by Richard et al [41], work that is outside the scope of the present\nS\nstudy. Our result do instead establish a valuable connectSion between well-defined physics\nE\nbased quantities, the TDs, and mechanical response of the system. R\nIn recent years, various machine learning (ML) approaches, both supervised and unsuper-\nP\nvised, have been employed to detect and quanti fy structural heterogeneities and defect-like\nN\nregions in glass-forming systems [42–46]. While these methods have yielded valuable in-\nI\nsights into dynamic heterogeneity andEplasticity, they often require a large number of micro-\nL\nscopic descriptors. In contrast, our approach leverages quantities derived from vibrational\nC\neigenmodes to identify topological defects without supervision or descriptors, allowing for a\nI\nT\nmore transparent, physically interpretable characterization. This simplicity of our method\nR\nfacilitates to establish a clearer connection between microscopic eigenmode geometry and\nA\nemergent plasticity morphology. In this way, our results not only extends the insights gained\nfrom ML-based frameworks but may also offer useful insights for constructing more inter-\npretable [47, 48], physics-informed ML models for amorphous materials. InthefutureitwillbeimportanttoinvestigatehowthearrangementoftheTDsisrelated\nto the brittleness of the glass since this might allow to make prediction of this important\nmaterial properties directly from the unsheared sample. In addition it can be expected that\nalso the nature of the fracture occurring beyond the yielding point is related to the presence\nof the TDs, with zones that have a high local density of positive TDs being avoided by the\nfracture front since they are mechanically more stable. Also the evolution of the geometrical\narrangement of the TDs under cyclic shear is an important question, since it should allow\nto gain important insight into the aging behavior of glasses under mechanical stress. We also point out that recent research on the generation of ultra-stable glasses [49],\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nutilizing techniques such as random pinning/bonding [50–53], highlights the important role\nof quenched disorder in the vitrification process, see also Ref.

This corresSpondence, rather than the abso-\nlute value of d , is another important physical insight wEhich indicates that the morphology\nf\nR\nof plastic rearrangements is organized by the pre-existing topology of low-frequency eigen-\nP\nmodes.

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In this study, we numerically investigate for a prototypical three dimensional glass the\nS\ngeometry and statistical properties of eigenvectors associSated with the vibrational eigen-\nE\nmodes, with a special focus on the TDs generated by these modes. Although the definition\nR\nof these TDs is related to the one considered in an earlier study of 2D systems, we point out\nP\nthat the generalization to 3D is not a trivial ste p. We find that at low frequencies the spa-\nN\ntial arrangement of these TDs form one-dimensional structures that have a scale-invariant\nI\ngeometry with a power-law exponent around −5/3, a value that can be rationalized from\nE\nthe quasi-linear structure of the fiLlaments formed by the TDs, and hence is expected to\nC\nbe universal. When subjected to quasistatic shear, the resulting plastic events are strongly\nI\nT\ncorrelated with defects carrying a negative topological charge, revealing a close connection\nR\nbetween TDs and plastic yielding. Remarkably, the spatial distribution of plastic events\nA\nunder shear mirrors the scaling behavior observed for the topological defects, reinforcing\nthe idea that the eigenmode geometry plays a fundamental role for the plastic behavior of\namorphous solids.

In the following we will use reduced units, reporting length\nand energy in terms of the size of the large particles and the well depth of the Lennard-\nJones potential, respectively. The system, containing N=800,000 particles in a box of size\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n(87.36)3, was equilibrated at a low temperature (T = 0.43), before it was cooled down to\nzero temperature.

    "answer": "The number of topological defects (TDs) grows as the square of the frequency (ω²) because, as long as the system can be considered an elastic continuum, this relationship is independent of the system dimension. The scaling arises from the interference of low-frequency acoustic modes, where the typical inter-line spacing scales as ∼ ω⁻¹, leading to a line density that scales as ω². This behavior is consistent with the complex patterns formed by the TDs as the frequency increases, where positive and negative TDs begin to interfere, further contributing to the increase in their number.",

Two recent studies have highlighted the use of TD in amorphous systems. Bera et al. [26]\nidentified isolated point defects using the non-affine displacement field in 2D slices of a 3D\nsample, and observed a temporal correlation with plastic flow. Subsequently this group\nintroduced a 3D hedgehog defect [27], and found that at low frequencies the number of such\ndefects increases like ω2 and that the location of these defects in non-affine displacements\ncorrelates well with plastic events of the sheared system, in qualitative agreement with\nour findings.

I\nUsing the identification of topologiEcal defects related to the vibrational modes, and in-\nL\nspired by previous studies in 2D [20], we have studied the correlation between the TDs and\nC\nthe plastic events that occur uInder shear deformation. A strong correlation between nega-\nT\ntive defects and plastic events is found, as in the case of 2D, and the spatial distribution of\nR\nthe PEs shows the saAme power-law as the TDs, which indicates that plasticity is encoded\nin the vibrational structure. Such a connection between quasi-linear topological defects and\nplasticity is reminiscent of the case of plasticity in crystals. Dislocations in crystals, acting\nas primary carriers of plastic deformation, result from distortions in the underlying order\nparameter, i.e., crystalline symmetry, characterized by Burgers vectors and slip planes [40]. In contrast, the TDs related to the eigenmodes of glasses do not form a regular lattice and\narise from the superposition of acoustic waves (interacting with local disorder) rather than\nfrom a broken translational symmetry. This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems.",

    "answer": "The growth of the number of topological defects (TDs) as the cubic frequency can be attributed to the underlying geometry and interactions of the TDs in the system. Specifically, it has been shown that the number of TDs scales with the square of the frequency, ω², which is a behavior that remains consistent across different system dimensions. This scaling arises because, at low frequencies, the eigenvectors of the system can be represented as a superposition of transverse plane waves, leading to the formation of one-dimensional structures of TDs.\n\nAs the frequency increases, the spatial arrangement of these TDs becomes more complex, with positive and negative lines starting to interfere with each other, which contributes to the increase in their density. The inter-line spacing is inversely related to the frequency, scaling as ω⁻¹, which means that as the frequency increases, the TDs become more densely packed.

[39], although in that study no connection with TDs was\nmade. This observation supports thus the view that the results we have obtained regarding\nthe structural arrangements of the TDs are generic. Two recent studies have highlighted the use of TD in amorphous systems. Bera et al. [26]\nidentified isolated point defects using the non-affine displacement field in 2D slices of a 3D\nsample, and observed a temporal correlation with plastic flow. Subsequently this group\nintroduced a 3D hedgehog defect [27], and found that at low frequencies the number of such\ndefects increases like ω2 and that the location of these defects in non-affine displacements\ncorrelates well with plastic events of the sheared system, in qualitative agreement with\nour findings. However, instead of focusing on isolated point defects, we reconstruct their\nS\nconnectivity into extended, quasi-linear TD lines that caSpture the spatial continuity and\nE\nnetworkgeometryofTDs, featuresthatareinaccessibletoslice-basedorpoint-wiseanalyses.

I\nUsing the identification of topologiEcal defects related to the vibrational modes, and in-\nL\nspired by previous studies in 2D [20], we have studied the correlation between the TDs and\nC\nthe plastic events that occur uInder shear deformation. A strong correlation between nega-\nT\ntive defects and plastic events is found, as in the case of 2D, and the spatial distribution of\nR\nthe PEs shows the saAme power-law as the TDs, which indicates that plasticity is encoded\nin the vibrational structure. Such a connection between quasi-linear topological defects and\nplasticity is reminiscent of the case of plasticity in crystals. Dislocations in crystals, acting\nas primary carriers of plastic deformation, result from distortions in the underlying order\nparameter, i.e., crystalline symmetry, characterized by Burgers vectors and slip planes [40]. In contrast, the TDs related to the eigenmodes of glasses do not form a regular lattice and\narise from the superposition of acoustic waves (interacting with local disorder) rather than\nfrom a broken translational symmetry. This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems.",

    "answer": "The increase in the number of topological defects (TDs) in a 3D hedgehog defect as a function of frequency can be attributed to the ω²-scaling relationship observed in elastic continua. As frequency increases, the spatial arrangement of TDs becomes more complex, leading to a denser packing of these defects. This phenomenon is particularly evident at frequencies above approximately 1.4, where the interactions between positive and negative TDs begin to significantly influence their distribution.\n\nAt lower frequencies, the TDs tend to form well-separated structures, but as frequency rises, the separation decreases, resulting in a rapid increase in the number of TDs. This behavior is linked to the interference patterns created by the acoustic modes, which dictate the geometry of the TDs and their interactions. The scaling of the line density of TDs with frequency, specifically the ω² dependence, reflects the underlying mechanics of the system and the nature of the vibrational modes present. Thus, the relationship between the number of TDs and frequency can be understood as a direct consequence of the complex interplay between these vibrational modes and the spatial organization of the defects.",

Since the TD are defined via the plaquettes given\nin Eq.

The weighted\ndensity field of the TDs at position R is thus given by Ω(R) = Ω (R)+Ω (R)+Ω (R),\nxy xz yz\nwhere, e.g., the field Ω is defined by\nxy\n1 (cid:88) 1 (cid:88) ν\ni,xy\nΩ (R) = Π(z −Z) .

The function Π(z −Z) is a rectangle functio n (with a width of the discretization of the\ni N\nfield) which assures that the TDs are only visible in the xy-plane, but not outside of this\nI\nplane. Thus essentially each TD is mEultiplied with a planar 1/r-type convolution kernel\nL\nfunction which smooths it spatially over some length scales in the plane it belongs to. This\nC\nsmoothening process quantifies the influence of a topological charge ν placed at a distance\nI\nT\nr, which in our case has the physical meaning of measuring how much the local orientation\nR\nof the field varies onAa circular circuit of radius r around the defect core, hence taking into\naccount the interference effect between different TDs.

Therefore, if the resolution of the discretization of the field u(R) is\nsufficiently high, there will be two faces, not necessarily opposite on the cube, that display a\nnet phase change of 2π (or −2π), i.e., knowledge of whether two vortex points in neighboring\nplanes form part of the same line is only limited by the spatial resolution. Ambiguities in\nthe counting of the TD related to, e.g., nonzero winding on more than two faces of a voxel,\ncan in principle be resolved by using a finer mesh.

Since the TD are defined via the plaquettes given\nin Eq. (2), i.e., they have orientational information on the eigenvector field, we keep track\nof this information by taking the average only in the plane of the plaquette. The weighted\ndensity field of the TDs at position R is thus given by Ω(R) = Ω (R)+Ω (R)+Ω (R),\nxy xz yz\nwhere, e.g., the field Ω is defined by\nxy\n1 (cid:88) 1 (cid:88) ν\ni,xy\nΩ (R) = Π(z −Z) .

The function Π(z −Z) is a rectangle functio n (with a width of the discretization of the\ni N\nfield) which assures that the TDs are only visible in the xy-plane, but not outside of this\nI\nplane. Thus essentially each TD is mEultiplied with a planar 1/r-type convolution kernel\nL\nfunction which smooths it spatially over some length scales in the plane it belongs to. This\nC\nsmoothening process quantifies the influence of a topological charge ν placed at a distance\nI\nT\nr, which in our case has the physical meaning of measuring how much the local orientation\nR\nof the field varies onAa circular circuit of radius r around the defect core, hence taking into\naccount the interference effect between different TDs.

For each box that is part of a vortex line, the vortex must enter from one face of the box and\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nexit from another face. Therefore, if the resolution of the discretization of the field u(R) is\nsufficiently high, there will be two faces, not necessarily opposite on the cube, that display a\nnet phase change of 2π (or −2π), i.e., knowledge of whether two vortex points in neighboring\nplanes form part of the same line is only limited by the spatial resolution. Ambiguities in\nthe counting of the TD related to, e.g., nonzero winding on more than two faces of a voxel,\ncan in principle be resolved by using a finer mesh. However, it turns out that with the\nmesh size we use the number of such cases is in practice very small and hence they do not\nalter the overall analysis in a significant manner. In the Supplementary Information (SI),\nthis procedure is applied to simple synthetic vector fields, showing that it does indeed allow\nto identify vortex or antivortex lines. It is important to note that our detection procedure\nS\nfor the TDs is agnostic with regard to the geometrical aSrrangement of the defects, and\nin particular does not impose a line-like morphology foEr this arrangement. The procedure\nR\nconsists of two decoupled steps: We first locate zeros of the eigenvector field amplitude and\nP\nassign a local topological index by evaluating t he phase winding on each plaquette of the\nN\nvoxels. This step uses only local information and introduces no geometric bias. We then\nI\nreconstruct connectivity by linking neighboring cells whose local indices are consistent. This\nE\nreveals the intrinsic dimensionalityLof the zero set: Isolated zeros remain point-like; if zeros\nC\ncontinue coherently across adjacent cells, a one-dimensional locus (TD line) emerges.

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In this study, we numerically investigate for a prototypical three dimensional glass the\nS\ngeometry and statistical properties of eigenvectors associSated with the vibrational eigen-\nE\nmodes, with a special focus on the TDs generated by these modes. Although the definition\nR\nof these TDs is related to the one considered in an earlier study of 2D systems, we point out\nP\nthat the generalization to 3D is not a trivial ste p. We find that at low frequencies the spa-\nN\ntial arrangement of these TDs form one-dimensional structures that have a scale-invariant\nI\ngeometry with a power-law exponent around −5/3, a value that can be rationalized from\nE\nthe quasi-linear structure of the fiLlaments formed by the TDs, and hence is expected to\nC\nbe universal. When subjected to quasistatic shear, the resulting plastic events are strongly\nI\nT\ncorrelated with defects carrying a negative topological charge, revealing a close connection\nR\nbetween TDs and plastic yielding. Remarkably, the spatial distribution of plastic events\nA\nunder shear mirrors the scaling behavior observed for the topological defects, reinforcing\nthe idea that the eigenmode geometry plays a fundamental role for the plastic behavior of\namorphous solids. RESULTS\nSystem\nWe study a binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles, using a model that has been exten-\nsively investigated in the past [33], applying a small modification to avoid the crystallization\nat the lowest temperatures [34]. In the following we will use reduced units, reporting length\nand energy in terms of the size of the large particles and the well depth of the Lennard-\nJones potential, respectively. The system, containing N=800,000 particles in a box of size\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n(87.36)3, was equilibrated at a low temperature (T = 0.43), before it was cooled down to\nzero temperature. More details on the model and simulations are given in the Methods\nsection. Topological defects\nThe first 10,000 vibrational normal modes of the system are obtained by diagonalizing the\nHessian matrix using ARPACK, see Methods for details. The lowest frequency is ω = 0.280,\nwhile the highest one is 2.24, slightly below the main peak in the vibrational density of\nstates, see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. To identify the topological defects of a given\neigenvector with components (ex,ey,ez), i = 1,... N, we first define a continuous vector\ni i i\nfield u(R) by interpolating between the positions of the particles:\nS\n(cid:80) (cid:80) S\nu(R) = w(R−r )e / w(R−r ) , (1)\ni i i i E i\nR\nwhere r is the location of particle i, e is the eigenvector component for particle i, and w\ni i\nP\nis a Gaussian weighting function, w(R−r ) = exp(−|R−r |2/∆2), with a width of ∆ = 1. i i\nN\n(The exact value of ∆ is not crucial as long it is on the order of the size of a particle.)\nI\nThe topology of this vector field is then analyzed by projecting it on a cubic lattice of size\nE\n88×88×88 superimposed to the samLple (the length of the unit cell is thus ≈ 1).

    "answer": "Maabreh's attack method, which involves a clustering-based label-flipping approach, works effectively with several machine learning algorithms. Specifically, it shows promising results when applied to K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Binary Decision Tree (BDT) models. However, it does not perform well with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Random Forest (RF) models, as these algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under the influence of poisoned training samples. This indicates that while Maabreh's method can disrupt certain classifiers, it fails to impact others significantly, particularly those that are more robust against such adversarial attacks.",

Such is the capability progression in our scenario:\nIn AI 2027, these capabilities are sufficient for the AI to be an SC, though we have high\nuncertainty regarding what time horizon might be needed.

Then, they will use existing control\ntechniques like red-teaming, scalable oversight, and honesty probes to monitor it. Then, once\nthey are convinced that it is broadly aligned, they use it to develop and test better strategies\nto align the next generation. Step 1, aligning Agent-3, has partially succeeded: Agent-3 is not adversarial. (That is, it’s\nnot scheming against the company.) However, it’s not robustly truth-seeking and truth-\ntelling either. Instead, it’s very good at producing impressive results, but is more accurately\ndescribed as trying to do what looks good to OpenBrain, as opposed to what is actually good. Step 2, verifying that the model is aligned, is inconclusive. Agent-3’s behavior in practice\nand in test environments is reasonably consistent with the hypothesis that it’s internalized\nthe Spec in the right way; however, it’s also consistent with the hypothesis that it’ll start\nacting differently after some future change of circumstances, and for that matter with the\nhypothesis that it’s plotting against them and just biding its time.

    "answer": "According to the AI 2027 paper, the timeline for AGI development is projected to see significant advancements by 2027. The authors, including Daniel Kokotajlo and Scott Alexander, suggest that the arrival of AGI could occur within the next five years, with predictions aligning around 2026 or 2027. They emphasize that the impact of superhuman AI will be profound, potentially surpassing the effects of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBy mid-2025, the paper anticipates the emergence of AI agents that will begin to transform various professions, although widespread adoption may be slow. The authors also note that by July 2027, OpenBrain is expected to announce the achievement of AGI with the release of Agent-3-mini, a model that, while less capable than its predecessor, will be significantly cheaper and more efficient.\n\nThe paper underscores the urgency of preparing society for these developments, as the capabilities of AI systems are expected to evolve rapidly, with superhuman coders likely becoming a reality by early 2027. Overall, the authors express a mix of optimism and caution regarding the future of AGI, highlighting the need for careful consideration of its implications.",

The CEOs of OpenAI,\nGoogle DeepMind, and Anthropic have all predicted that AGI will arrive\nwithin the next 5 years. Sam Altman has said OpenAI is setting its sights on\n“superintelligence in the true sense of the word” and the “glorious future.”\nIt’s tempting to dismiss this as just hype. This would be a grave mistake—it is\nnot just hype. We have no desire to hype AI ourselves, yet we also think it is\nstrikingly plausible that superintelligence could arrive by the end of the decade. If we’re on the cusp of superintelligence, society is nowhere near prepared. Very few people have even attempted to articulate any plausible path through\nthe development of superintelligence. We wrote AI 2027 to fill that gap,\nproviding much needed concrete detail. We would love to see more work like\nthis in the world, especially from people who disagree with us. We hope that\nby doing this, we’ll spark a broad conversation about where we’re headed and\nhow to steer toward positive futures. We wrote this scenario by repeatedly asking ourselves “what would happen\nnext”. We started at the present day, writing the first period (up to mid-2025),\nthen the following period, until we reached the ending. We weren’t trying to\nreach any particular ending. We then scrapped it and started over again, many\ntimes, until we had a finished scenario that we thought was plausible.

    "answer": "In the late 20th century, Madrid's urban planning was significantly influenced by a blend of architectural styles, with a notable emphasis on late urban expressionism. This period followed the municipal government's Plan General de Ordenación Urbana de Madrid (PGOUM) of 1985, which aimed to curb the city's physical expansion and focus on inner-city development. Architects like Rafael Moneo and Saenz de Oiza were pivotal during this time, with Moneo's renovation of the Atocha train station being particularly influential.\n\nThe architectural landscape was characterized by a mix of traditional approaches and modernist principles, reflecting a transition from earlier conservative styles to a more eclectic and expressive form of design. This shift was partly a response to the cultural movements of the time, including the movida, which sought to redefine Madrid's identity in a post-Franco context. The late urban expressionist style, exemplified by Saenz de Oiza's controversial housing projects, represented a pragmatic approach to urban issues, focusing on social housing and community needs.\n\nOverall, the late 20th century in Madrid was marked by a complex interplay of modernist ideals and postmodern critiques, with architects navigating the challenges of urban identity and social justice within their designs.",

    "answer": "In the late 20th century, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, Madrid's urban planning was predominantly influenced by a blend of Modernist and Postmodern architectural styles. Following the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, the city experienced a significant transformation known as the \"transición,\" which saw a shift towards more progressive urban policies. The municipal government's Plan General de Ordenación Urbana de Madrid (PGOUM) established in 1985 aimed to address urban sprawl by focusing on inner-city development and improving public services in the suburbs.\n\nArchitects like Rafael Moneo and Sáenz de Oiza emerged as key figures during this period, with Moneo's renovation of the Atocha train station and Oiza's controversial housing projects exemplifying the era's architectural endeavors. While the city sought to modernize its infrastructure, the architectural output was often characterized by a pragmatic approach that balanced modern aesthetics with social considerations, leading to a unique expression of urban identity. This period marked a significant evolution in Madrid's architectural landscape, reflecting broader cultural and political changes within Spain.",

In this work, the new or extended O − C diagrams for 148 Galactic classical\nCepheids are presented. By correlating the calculated period change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational\nindications for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal position within the instability strip.

Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid\nfor longer period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing changes in their O − C diagrams\nthat are not or not only of evolutionary origin points towards the need for further studies for the complete understanding of\nthese effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period fluctuation in short period Cepheids, which occurs in\na significant fraction of the investigated stars.

Received 2022 January 11; in original form 2021 November 15\nA B S T R A C T\nInvestigating period changes of classical Cepheids through the framework of O − C diagrams provides a unique insight to\nthe evolution and nature of these variable stars. In this work, the new or extended O − C diagrams for 148 Galactic classical\nCepheids are presented. By correlating the calculated period change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational\nindications for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal position within the instability strip. We\nfind period fluctuations in 59 Cepheids with a confidence level of 99 per cent, which are distributed uniformly ov e r the inspected\nperiod range. Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid\nfor longer period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing changes in their O − C diagrams\nthat are not or not only of evolutionary origin points towards the need for further studies for the complete understanding of\nthese effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period fluctuation in short period Cepheids, which occurs in\na significant fraction of the investigated stars. The period dependence of the fluctuation strength and its minimum at the bump\nCepheid region suggests a stability enhancing mechanism for this period range, which agrees with current pulsation models.

Received 2022 January 11; in original form 2021 November 15\nA B S T R A C T\nInvestigating period changes of classical Cepheids through the framework of O − C diagrams provides a unique insight to\nthe evolution and nature of these variable stars. In this work, the new or extended O − C diagrams for 148 Galactic classical\nCepheids are presented. By correlating the calculated period change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational\nindications for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal position within the instability strip. We\nfind period fluctuations in 59 Cepheids with a confidence level of 99 per cent, which are distributed uniformly ov e r the inspected\nperiod range. Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid\nfor longer period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing changes in their O − C diagrams\nthat are not or not only of evolutionary origin points towards the need for further studies for the complete understanding of\nthese effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period fluctuation in short period Cepheids, which occurs in\na significant fraction of the investigated stars. The period dependence of the fluctuation strength and its minimum at the bump\nCepheid region suggests a stability enhancing mechanism for this period range, which agrees with current pulsation models.

    "answer": "The leader of the Catalan Company during its campaigns in the Byzantine Empire was Roger de Flor, who was a postate Templar and privateer extraordinary. He significantly advanced the victory of Frederick of Sicily during the latter years of the War of the Sicilian Vespers. Following this, he offered the services of the seasoned Spanish veterans to Emperor Andronicus II of Byzantium, who welcomed the company in 1303. After Roger's assassination in 1305, the leadership briefly passed to Entenza, a Catalan noble, until his capture by the Genoese. Eventually, Rocafort took control, but his leadership was soon challenged by others, including Arenos and the returning Entenza.",

    "answer": "The Catalan Company during its campaigns in the Byzantine Empire was led by Roger de Flor, a notable figure who played a significant role in the military exploits of the group. De Flor, originally from Brindisi, was a seasoned military leader and had previously served as a privateer. Under his command, the Company engaged in various successful operations against the Seljuk Turks and other adversaries in the region. After his assassination in early 1308, leadership briefly passed to a relative named Entenza before being taken over by Rocafort, who became the supreme leader by July 1309. The Catalan Company's actions during this period had a profound impact on the political landscape of the Byzantine Empire.",

    "answer": "The systematic literature review on AI safety identifies several main categories of challenges. These include concerns related to explainability, interpretability, robustness, reliability, fairness, bias, and adversarial attacks. Notably, the review emphasizes the importance of managing AI autonomy, verification and validation techniques, and understanding failure modes as critical areas for further research.\n\nAdditionally, the review highlights the necessity of developing AI systems that align with human values and operate within ethical frameworks. It points out that the interaction between humans and AI systems is a pivotal consideration, particularly as these systems become more autonomous. The authors argue that ensuring safety in AI requires a comprehensive framework that encompasses all stages of AI system development, from data management to deployment.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the need for ongoing exploration and innovation in AI safety to address these multifaceted challenges effectively.",

    "answer": "The systematic literature review on AI safety identifies several main categories of challenges. These include:\n\n1. **Safety of Learning Techniques**: This involves ensuring that reinforcement learning (RL) agents can explore their environments safely without causing harm. Key concerns in this area are safe exploration, resistance to distribution shifts, and managing undesirable side effects.\n\n2. **Verification and Validation**: This category focuses on the processes that ensure AI systems are reliable and meet safety standards. It emphasizes the importance of rigorous testing to identify biases and flaws in AI models.\n\n3. **Autonomy and Control**: This addresses the level of human oversight required for AI systems, particularly in safety-critical applications. It explores how varying levels of autonomy affect decision-making and accountability.\n\n4. **Explainability and Interpretability**: As AI systems become more complex, understanding their decision-making processes is crucial. This category deals with the challenges of making AI outputs understandable to users.\n\n5. **Adversarial Attacks**: This includes the need for AI systems to defend against malicious inputs that could compromise their safety and effectiveness.\n\nThese categories highlight the multifaceted nature of AI safety and the ongoing need for research and development in these areas to ensure trustworthy AI systems.",

      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: However, recently things have changed dramati-\ncally, since it has been realized that these functions contain important information about\nthe interference and superposition of quantum states, which allows to gain deep insight into\nthe properties of condensed quantum materials [4–9]. Interestingly this shift of paradigm\nstarts to occur also in the domain of glass physics. While in the past many studies focused\nS\non characterizing the vibrational density of states to rationalize the anomalous thermody-\nS\nnamic properties of glasses [10], only few investigationsEhave looked into the nature of the\nR\neigenmodes. Most of these studies concentrated on the question whether or not these modes\nP\nare localized or extended, a problem which is re levant for understanding the nature of the\nN\nso-called boson-peak [11–17]. However, very recently it has been suggested that also the\nI\ntopological properties of a glass can give important insight into the thermodynamic and\nE\nkinetic features of the material [18L, 19]. One example is the demonstration that in two\nC\ndimensions the geometry of the topological defects of the eigenvectors is closely correlated\nI\nto the plastic response in aTmorphous matter [20], which has recently been verified experi-\nR\nmentally in a 2D colloidal glass [21, 22]. Probing the topological properties of disordered\nA\nmaterials is thus a promising approach to advance our understanding of these complex sys-\ntems that have so far defied to reveal how their macroscopic behavior is connected to their\nmicroscopic structure [23]. It is important to realize that for a glass there is no unique way to define topological\ndefects (TD) and so far it is not clear which definition is the most useful for gaining insight\ninto a specific macroscopic property of the sample [20, 24–27]. Probing the influence of TDs\non material properties is also hampered by the fact that some TD definitions are applicable\nonly to two dimensional systems and cannot be generalized in a straightforward manner to\nD = 3. TDs arise, e.g., in the fields defined by the vibrational eigenvectors at the points in\nwhich the amplitude of the eigenfunction vanishes and hence its phase becomes undefined. Another example are TDs occurring in the displacement field generated when the sample\nis sheared, since then the trajectories of the particles can form loops around topological\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nvertices that can be transient or continuously reshaped by particle motion. For the cases\nof active matter and living systems its has, e.g., been well documented that topological\ndefects in the displacement fields can influence the dynamics or pattern formation of the\nsystems [28–32]. Note that these two types of TDs, i.e., in eigenvectors or displacement\nfields, differ not only in the nature of the field used to define them, but also by the fact\nthat with the first definition one considers a mechanically stable configuration, while the\nsecond one deals with an out-of-equilibrium response. Understanding the relevance of these\ndifferences is therefore crucial for exploring topological quantities in the study of amorphous\nmatter. In this study, we numerically investigate for a prototypical three dimensional glass the\nS\ngeometry and statistical properties of eigenvectors associSated with the vibrational eigen-\nE\nmodes, with a special focus on the TDs generated by these modes. Although the definition\nR\nof these TDs is related to the one considered in an earlier study of 2D systems, we point out\nP\nthat the generalization to 3D is not a trivial ste p.",
      "Paper: On the geometry of topological defects in glasses\n\n Authors: Zhen Wei Wu, Jean-Louis Barrat & Walter Kob\n\n Year: 2025\n\n Content: In contrast, the TDs related to the eigenmodes of glasses do not form a regular lattice and\narise from the superposition of acoustic waves (interacting with local disorder) rather than\nfrom a broken translational symmetry. This irregularity of the spatial arrangement of the\nTDs implies that their dynamics (when the sample is a bit perturbed) and interactions is\nmore complex and less predictable than in crystalline systems. In the context of yielding\nof glassy materials, in recent experiments where the samples were subjected to pure shear,\nthe TDs did form filamentary structures before condensating into shear bands [22]. These\nresults hint that it is indeed possible to probe in real systems the spatial arrangement of the\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTDs and therefore to test whether they do indeed show the fractal structure that we predict\nfrom our study. Note that in the present work we have only probed the correlation between the location\nof the TDs and those of the PEs. In principle it is possible to take also into account the\nstrength of the topological singularity and this might permit to improve the mentioned\ncorrelation. Such an analysis is, however, beyond the scope of the present work and is thus\nleft to future investigations. It is also important to clarify that we do not claim that the\nidentified correlation between the location of TD and PE make the TDs the best predictor\nregarding the occurrence of PEs. The quality of such a prediction would have to be assessed\nby following the approach by Richard et al [41], work that is outside the scope of the present\nS\nstudy. Our result do instead establish a valuable connectSion between well-defined physics\nE\nbased quantities, the TDs, and mechanical response of the system. R\nIn recent years, various machine learning (ML) approaches, both supervised and unsuper-\nP\nvised, have been employed to detect and quanti fy structural heterogeneities and defect-like\nN\nregions in glass-forming systems [42–46]. While these methods have yielded valuable in-\nI\nsights into dynamic heterogeneity andEplasticity, they often require a large number of micro-\nL\nscopic descriptors. In contrast, our approach leverages quantities derived from vibrational\nC\neigenmodes to identify topological defects without supervision or descriptors, allowing for a\nI\nT\nmore transparent, physically interpretable characterization. This simplicity of our method\nR\nfacilitates to establish a clearer connection between microscopic eigenmode geometry and\nA\nemergent plasticity morphology. In this way, our results not only extends the insights gained\nfrom ML-based frameworks but may also offer useful insights for constructing more inter-\npretable [47, 48], physics-informed ML models for amorphous materials. InthefutureitwillbeimportanttoinvestigatehowthearrangementoftheTDsisrelated\nto the brittleness of the glass since this might allow to make prediction of this important\nmaterial properties directly from the unsheared sample. In addition it can be expected that\nalso the nature of the fracture occurring beyond the yielding point is related to the presence\nof the TDs, with zones that have a high local density of positive TDs being avoided by the\nfracture front since they are mechanically more stable. Also the evolution of the geometrical\narrangement of the TDs under cyclic shear is an important question, since it should allow\nto gain important insight into the aging behavior of glasses under mechanical stress. We also point out that recent research on the generation of ultra-stable glasses [49],\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nutilizing techniques such as random pinning/bonding [50–53], highlights the important role\nof quenched disorder in the vitrification process, see also Ref.

It is thus tempting\nto speculate that the topological defects with positive charge can be considered to be a\nkind of quenched disorder that is related to the slowing down of the dynamics of the glass-\nformer since these defects are in regions that are mechanically stable. Hence it will also\nbe of interest to characterize the details of the geometry of the structure formed by the\nTDs, such as length of TD segments, angles between such segments, local densities, etc. This idea merits further exploration, as it offers a potentially interesting novel approach to\npredict the phenomenon of dynamic heterogeneity–one of the hallmark behaviors observed\ninsupercooledliquidsapproachingtheglasstransition, aswellasthedynamicslowing-down. S\nThe linear arrangement of TDs that we have documenteSd here can be found also in other\nfields of physics such as the vortex lines representing tEopological singularities in quantum\nR\nfluids/gases, where interference and phase factor of varying waves play an important role. P\nThese features are robust and at the origin of ene rgy cascades and dissipation processes that\nN\nexhibits a scale-invariant behavior [56, 57], making them a fundamental ingredient in wave-\nI\nbased systems.

Scaleinvarianceisahallmarkofcriticalphenomena,\nI\nT\nand its presence in amorphous materials suggests that plasticity and deformation processes\nR\nmight be related to critical-like/avalanche behavior [58–61] in which the system exhibits\nA\nself-similar organization across different length scales. This might imply that the plastic\nbehavior (or energy dissipation) of materials, whether crystalline [62], amorphous, or poly-\ncrystalline, follows universal scaling laws that are independent of the specific material but\ninstead depend only on the topology and elastic properties of the system. METHODS\nMD Simulation. The simulations were carried out for a system with N=800,000 and\nwe used a potential that is a slight modification of the standard Kob-Andersen potential. This modification (an addition of a linear term to the original portential) was proposed by\nSchrøder and Dyre and has the effect that crystallization is (so far) completely avoided [34]. --- Page 20 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nWe equilibrated the system at T = 0.430 (T =0.436) for 30 million steps (density was\nMCT\n1.200 and step size was 0.005) and then cooled the sample to T = 0 within 30 million\ntime steps. This slow cooling schedule ensures that the resulting samples are well-annealed\nand representative of stable glasses, as supported by previous studies [36] and confirmed by\nour stress–strain response (Supplementary Fig. 11) which exhibits sharp yielding transitions\ncharacteristic of well-annealed, mechanically stable glasses [63]. These features indicate the\nrobustness and reproducibility of the mechanical and topological analyses reported in this\nwork. Normal Modes.

Since the TD are defined via the plaquettes given\nin Eq.

The weighted\ndensity field of the TDs at position R is thus given by Ω(R) = Ω (R)+Ω (R)+Ω (R),\nxy xz yz\nwhere, e.g., the field Ω is defined by\nxy\n1 (cid:88) 1 (cid:88) ν\ni,xy\nΩ (R) = Π(z −Z) .

The function Π(z −Z) is a rectangle functio n (with a width of the discretization of the\ni N\nfield) which assures that the TDs are only visible in the xy-plane, but not outside of this\nI\nplane. Thus essentially each TD is mEultiplied with a planar 1/r-type convolution kernel\nL\nfunction which smooths it spatially over some length scales in the plane it belongs to. This\nC\nsmoothening process quantifies the influence of a topological charge ν placed at a distance\nI\nT\nr, which in our case has the physical meaning of measuring how much the local orientation\nR\nof the field varies onAa circular circuit of radius r around the defect core, hence taking into\naccount the interference effect between different TDs.

Interestingly this shift of paradigm\nstarts to occur also in the domain of glass physics. While in the past many studies focused\nS\non characterizing the vibrational density of states to rationalize the anomalous thermody-\nS\nnamic properties of glasses [10], only few investigationsEhave looked into the nature of the\nR\neigenmodes. Most of these studies concentrated on the question whether or not these modes\nP\nare localized or extended, a problem which is re levant for understanding the nature of the\nN\nso-called boson-peak [11–17]. However, very recently it has been suggested that also the\nI\ntopological properties of a glass can give important insight into the thermodynamic and\nE\nkinetic features of the material [18L, 19]. One example is the demonstration that in two\nC\ndimensions the geometry of the topological defects of the eigenvectors is closely correlated\nI\nto the plastic response in aTmorphous matter [20], which has recently been verified experi-\nR\nmentally in a 2D colloidal glass [21, 22]. Probing the topological properties of disordered\nA\nmaterials is thus a promising approach to advance our understanding of these complex sys-\ntems that have so far defied to reveal how their macroscopic behavior is connected to their\nmicroscopic structure [23]. It is important to realize that for a glass there is no unique way to define topological\ndefects (TD) and so far it is not clear which definition is the most useful for gaining insight\ninto a specific macroscopic property of the sample [20, 24–27]. Probing the influence of TDs\non material properties is also hampered by the fact that some TD definitions are applicable\nonly to two dimensional systems and cannot be generalized in a straightforward manner to\nD = 3. TDs arise, e.g., in the fields defined by the vibrational eigenvectors at the points in\nwhich the amplitude of the eigenfunction vanishes and hence its phase becomes undefined. Another example are TDs occurring in the displacement field generated when the sample\nis sheared, since then the trajectories of the particles can form loops around topological\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nvertices that can be transient or continuously reshaped by particle motion. For the cases\nof active matter and living systems its has, e.g., been well documented that topological\ndefects in the displacement fields can influence the dynamics or pattern formation of the\nsystems [28–32]. Note that these two types of TDs, i.e., in eigenvectors or displacement\nfields, differ not only in the nature of the field used to define them, but also by the fact\nthat with the first definition one considers a mechanically stable configuration, while the\nsecond one deals with an out-of-equilibrium response.

[54, 55]. It is thus tempting\nto speculate that the topological defects with positive charge can be considered to be a\nkind of quenched disorder that is related to the slowing down of the dynamics of the glass-\nformer since these defects are in regions that are mechanically stable. Hence it will also\nbe of interest to characterize the details of the geometry of the structure formed by the\nTDs, such as length of TD segments, angles between such segments, local densities, etc. This idea merits further exploration, as it offers a potentially interesting novel approach to\npredict the phenomenon of dynamic heterogeneity–one of the hallmark behaviors observed\ninsupercooledliquidsapproachingtheglasstransition, aswellasthedynamicslowing-down. S\nThe linear arrangement of TDs that we have documenteSd here can be found also in other\nfields of physics such as the vortex lines representing tEopological singularities in quantum\nR\nfluids/gases, where interference and phase factor of varying waves play an important role. P\nThese features are robust and at the origin of ene rgy cascades and dissipation processes that\nN\nexhibits a scale-invariant behavior [56, 57], making them a fundamental ingredient in wave-\nI\nbased systems. The scale-invariance that we haveidentified inthe spatial organization of our\nE\nTDs hints therefore at a possible uLniversality regarding how defects organize and interact\nC\nacrossawiderangeofphysicalsystems. Scaleinvarianceisahallmarkofcriticalphenomena,\nI\nT\nand its presence in amorphous materials suggests that plasticity and deformation processes\nR\nmight be related to critical-like/avalanche behavior [58–61] in which the system exhibits\nA\nself-similar organization across different length scales. This might imply that the plastic\nbehavior (or energy dissipation) of materials, whether crystalline [62], amorphous, or poly-\ncrystalline, follows universal scaling laws that are independent of the specific material but\ninstead depend only on the topology and elastic properties of the system. METHODS\nMD Simulation. The simulations were carried out for a system with N=800,000 and\nwe used a potential that is a slight modification of the standard Kob-Andersen potential. This modification (an addition of a linear term to the original portential) was proposed by\nSchrøder and Dyre and has the effect that crystallization is (so far) completely avoided [34]. --- Page 20 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nWe equilibrated the system at T = 0.430 (T =0.436) for 30 million steps (density was\nMCT\n1.200 and step size was 0.005) and then cooled the sample to T = 0 within 30 million\ntime steps. This slow cooling schedule ensures that the resulting samples are well-annealed\nand representative of stable glasses, as supported by previous studies [36] and confirmed by\nour stress–strain response (Supplementary Fig. 11) which exhibits sharp yielding transitions\ncharacteristic of well-annealed, mechanically stable glasses [63]. These features indicate the\nrobustness and reproducibility of the mechanical and topological analyses reported in this\nwork. Normal Modes. A conjugate gradient energy minimization process was used to get the\nS\ninherent structure of the configuration, and subsequently the vibrational normal modes were\nS\nobtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix D which is defined as\nE\nR\n1 ∂2U(rN)\nD = √ P.

Since the TD are defined via the plaquettes given\nin Eq. (2), i.e., they have orientational information on the eigenvector field, we keep track\nof this information by taking the average only in the plane of the plaquette. The weighted\ndensity field of the TDs at position R is thus given by Ω(R) = Ω (R)+Ω (R)+Ω (R),\nxy xz yz\nwhere, e.g., the field Ω is defined by\nxy\n1 (cid:88) 1 (cid:88) ν\ni,xy\nΩ (R) = Π(z −Z) .

The function Π(z −Z) is a rectangle functio n (with a width of the discretization of the\ni N\nfield) which assures that the TDs are only visible in the xy-plane, but not outside of this\nI\nplane. Thus essentially each TD is mEultiplied with a planar 1/r-type convolution kernel\nL\nfunction which smooths it spatially over some length scales in the plane it belongs to. This\nC\nsmoothening process quantifies the influence of a topological charge ν placed at a distance\nI\nT\nr, which in our case has the physical meaning of measuring how much the local orientation\nR\nof the field varies onAa circular circuit of radius r around the defect core, hence taking into\naccount the interference effect between different TDs.

It is thus tempting\nto speculate that the topological defects with positive charge can be considered to be a\nkind of quenched disorder that is related to the slowing down of the dynamics of the glass-\nformer since these defects are in regions that are mechanically stable. Hence it will also\nbe of interest to characterize the details of the geometry of the structure formed by the\nTDs, such as length of TD segments, angles between such segments, local densities, etc. This idea merits further exploration, as it offers a potentially interesting novel approach to\npredict the phenomenon of dynamic heterogeneity–one of the hallmark behaviors observed\ninsupercooledliquidsapproachingtheglasstransition, aswellasthedynamicslowing-down. S\nThe linear arrangement of TDs that we have documenteSd here can be found also in other\nfields of physics such as the vortex lines representing tEopological singularities in quantum\nR\nfluids/gases, where interference and phase factor of varying waves play an important role. P\nThese features are robust and at the origin of ene rgy cascades and dissipation processes that\nN\nexhibits a scale-invariant behavior [56, 57], making them a fundamental ingredient in wave-\nI\nbased systems. The scale-invariance that we haveidentified inthe spatial organization of our\nE\nTDs hints therefore at a possible uLniversality regarding how defects organize and interact\nC\nacrossawiderangeofphysicalsystems. Scaleinvarianceisahallmarkofcriticalphenomena,\nI\nT\nand its presence in amorphous materials suggests that plasticity and deformation processes\nR\nmight be related to critical-like/avalanche behavior [58–61] in which the system exhibits\nA\nself-similar organization across different length scales. This might imply that the plastic\nbehavior (or energy dissipation) of materials, whether crystalline [62], amorphous, or poly-\ncrystalline, follows universal scaling laws that are independent of the specific material but\ninstead depend only on the topology and elastic properties of the system. METHODS\nMD Simulation. The simulations were carried out for a system with N=800,000 and\nwe used a potential that is a slight modification of the standard Kob-Andersen potential. This modification (an addition of a linear term to the original portential) was proposed by\nSchrøder and Dyre and has the effect that crystallization is (so far) completely avoided [34]. --- Page 20 ---\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nWe equilibrated the system at T = 0.430 (T =0.436) for 30 million steps (density was\nMCT\n1.200 and step size was 0.005) and then cooled the sample to T = 0 within 30 million\ntime steps. This slow cooling schedule ensures that the resulting samples are well-annealed\nand representative of stable glasses, as supported by previous studies [36] and confirmed by\nour stress–strain response (Supplementary Fig. 11) which exhibits sharp yielding transitions\ncharacteristic of well-annealed, mechanically stable glasses [63]. These features indicate the\nrobustness and reproducibility of the mechanical and topological analyses reported in this\nwork. Normal Modes. A conjugate gradient energy minimization process was used to get the\nS\ninherent structure of the configuration, and subsequently the vibrational normal modes were\nS\nobtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix D which is defined as\nE\nR\n1 ∂2U(rN)\nD = √ P.

Since the TD are defined via the plaquettes given\nin Eq. (2), i.e., they have orientational information on the eigenvector field, we keep track\nof this information by taking the average only in the plane of the plaquette. The weighted\ndensity field of the TDs at position R is thus given by Ω(R) = Ω (R)+Ω (R)+Ω (R),\nxy xz yz\nwhere, e.g., the field Ω is defined by\nxy\n1 (cid:88) 1 (cid:88) ν\ni,xy\nΩ (R) = Π(z −Z) .

The function Π(z −Z) is a rectangle functio n (with a width of the discretization of the\ni N\nfield) which assures that the TDs are only visible in the xy-plane, but not outside of this\nI\nplane. Thus essentially each TD is mEultiplied with a planar 1/r-type convolution kernel\nL\nfunction which smooths it spatially over some length scales in the plane it belongs to.

    "answer": "To estimate the depth of Yosemite Valley over geological time, researchers employed several methods, primarily focusing on thermochronometric analysis. Notably, the study utilized apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, which was applied to granitoid bedrock samples collected from various locations within and around the valley. This technique, which had not been previously used for canyon development, allowed for the measurement of radiogenic helium loss from apatite crystals, providing insights into the thermal history of the rocks.\n\nAdditionally, the research incorporated numerical models of crustal temperatures beneath evolving topography, which helped demonstrate significant late Cenozoic deepening of Tenaya Canyon. The findings indicated that approximately 40%–90% of the current relief in Yosemite Valley developed since 10 million years ago, with most of this occurring after 5 million years ago. The study also referenced glacial erosion and tectonic uplift as contributing factors to canyon incision, suggesting that the interplay between these processes influenced the valley's depth.\n\nFurthermore, the research highlighted that the total accumulated helium measured from the apatite crystals corresponded to ages indicating that some parts of Yosemite Valley may have resided 1.5–3 kilometers below the surface for significant periods, with ages of around 40 million years at the bottom of the valley and 60 million years on the surrounding uplands. These findings provide critical constraints on the timing and mechanisms behind the valley's formation and deepening.",

    "answer": "To estimate the depth of Yosemite Valley over geological time, researchers employed several advanced methods. One prominent technique was thermochronometry, specifically using apatite (U-Th)/He dating, which allowed for the analysis of radiogenic helium in apatite crystals collected from various locations within and around the valley. This method provided insights into the thermal history of the rocks, which is crucial for understanding the timing of canyon incision.\n\nAdditionally, the study utilized 4He/3He thermochronometry, a technique not previously applied to canyon development in this region. This approach helped to quantify the diffusive loss of radiogenic helium from the apatite crystals, which correlates with temperature changes over geological time. By integrating these thermochronometric data with numerical models of crustal temperatures, researchers were able to demonstrate significant deepening of the valley, particularly in Tenaya Canyon, indicating that substantial incision occurred prior to the mid-Pleistocene.\n\nThe findings suggest that approximately 42% to 92% of the current valley relief has developed since around 9 million years ago, with most of this activity likely occurring in the last 4 million years. This research not only clarifies the geological history of Yosemite Valley but also contributes to broader debates regarding the tectonic and geomorphological evolution of the Sierra Nevada region.",

    "answer": "The Catalan Company first arrived in Constantinople in 1303. This was facilitated by Roger de Flor, who had previously supported Frederick of Sicily during the War of the Sicilian Vespers. After receiving the blessing of Frederick, he offered the services of the Company to Emperor Andronicus II of Byzantium, which included a significant force of seasoned Spanish veterans. Their arrival marked the beginning of a complex relationship with the Byzantine Empire, which would lead to significant military exploits in the region.",

    "answer": "RX Aurigae is a classical Cepheid variable that has been studied in relation to the changes in pulsation periods of various Cepheid stars. It is particularly noted for its peculiar O − C diagrams, which exhibit features that cannot be solely explained by evolutionary changes. The study of RX Aurigae contributes to the broader understanding of Cepheid variables, especially in the context of binary systems and their effects on pulsation characteristics.\n\nIn terms of its orbital period, RX Aurigae has been associated with an orbital period of approximately 37,928 ± 7,678 days. This long period is significant as it allows for the detection of orbital modulation effects in the O − C diagrams, which can indicate the presence of a binary companion. The analysis of such orbital parameters is crucial for refining existing models of Cepheid behavior and understanding their evolutionary trends.\n\nOverall, RX Aurigae's relationship with the Cepheid study highlights the complexities of pulsation periods and the influence of binarity on these variables.",

    "answer": "RX Aurigae is a classical Cepheid variable star that has garnered attention in the study of pulsation periods and their changes. It is particularly relevant to the broader research on Cepheids due to its potential binary nature, which can influence the observed pulsation characteristics. In recent studies, including a comprehensive analysis of 152 Galactic Cepheid variables, it was noted that some of these stars exhibit peculiar O − C diagrams, which are indicative of complex behaviors not fully explained by evolutionary models.\n\nRegarding its orbital period, RX Aurigae has been suggested to have an orbital period of approximately 38,000 ± 7,500 days, translating to about 104.5 years. This long orbital period allows for the detection of light-time effects (LiTE), which can provide insights into the star's binary dynamics and contribute to the understanding of its pulsation variations. The amplitude of these variations has been measured at around 0.26 days, which is consistent with the characteristics observed in similar Cepheid variables. \n\nOverall, RX Aurigae serves as an important case study in the ongoing exploration of Cepheid variables and their complex behaviors within binary systems.",

    "answer": "The isotopic history of Yosemite, as revealed through thermochronometric analysis of apatite crystals, indicates significant late Cenozoic deepening of Tenaya Canyon, with approximately 40%–90% of the current relief developing since 10 Ma and most likely since 5 Ma. This period coincides with renewed regional tectonism, which is debated as a driver of canyon development. The study suggests that major canyon incision occurred prior to 40 Ma, indicating a similar antiquity for Yosemite itself. The isotopic data also show that the thermal history of rocks now exposed at the surface is influenced by erosion and topographic evolution, with the measured ages corresponding to when samples resided approximately 1.5–3 km below the surface.",

    "answer": "The isotopic history of Yosemite Valley provides significant insights into its geological evolution, particularly regarding the timing and processes of canyon formation. According to the research conducted by Cuffey et al. (2022), approximately 40%–90% of the current relief in Yosemite has developed since 5 Ma, with substantial incision occurring prior to this time. This deepening is attributed to a combination of tectonic uplift and glacial processes, although the precise mechanisms remain debated.\n\nInterestingly, the study suggests that the canyon's formation may have coincided with significant geological events, such as volcanic activity and faulting, which influenced drainage patterns. The isotopic data, particularly from apatite thermochronometry, indicate that the thermal history of the rocks correlates with their depth below the surface, revealing that major canyon incision likely occurred after 30 Ma, aligning with findings from other studies (McPhillips and Brandon, 2012).\n\nMoreover, the isotopic analysis highlights that the Sierra Nevada's uplift and the associated thermal gradients played a crucial role in shaping the landscape. While earlier assumptions suggested that major canyon formation coincided with Pleistocene glaciation, the isotopic evidence points to a more complex history involving multiple geological processes over millions of years.\n\nIn summary, the isotopic history underscores that Yosemite's evolution is marked by significant late Cenozoic changes, driven by a combination of tectonic uplift and glacial erosion, with isotopic data providing a clearer picture of the timing and nature of",

    "answer": "The isotopic history of Yosemite reveals significant insights into its geological evolution, particularly during the late Cenozoic era. Recent studies indicate that approximately 42%–92% of the current topography has developed since around 11 million years ago, with substantial changes likely occurring since about 6 million years ago. This period corresponds with renewed tectonic activity, which has been a long-discussed factor in the development of the Sierra Nevada canyons.\n\nThe isotopic data, particularly from apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, suggest that major canyon incision in Yosemite Valley likely occurred prior to the mid-Pleistocene glaciation, with some evidence indicating that significant geological events may have begun as early as 39 million years ago. This contrasts with earlier assumptions that canyon formation was primarily linked to tectonic movements or glacial processes.\n\nMoreover, the isotopic analysis provides a clearer understanding of the thermal history of the rocks, revealing that the region experienced varying erosion rates influenced by the topography and climatic conditions. The findings underscore the complexity of Yosemite's formation, suggesting that both tectonic uplift and glacial activity played crucial roles in shaping the valley's current landscape.",
